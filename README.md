## Category notes

- `tips-and-tricks` vs `tutorials` : `tutorials` have to include a complete guide as much as possible,
  e.g. steps to register the repository/app. `tips-and-tricks` is short, only describes the thing it
  wants to achieve. Later can be moved into `tutorial`, by adding more info.
