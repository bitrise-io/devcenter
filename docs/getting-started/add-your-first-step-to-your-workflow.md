Once you register an app you can start to modify it's Workflow,
to customize how a build should work.

To edit your App's Workflow you should open the `Workflow Editor`:

1. Select your App on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io)
2. Select the `Workflow` tab

Once you're in the Workflow Editor you can see the list of Steps which are already in your Workflow.

## Add a new Step to the Workflow

If you want to **add a new Step** to the Workflow,
just click the `+` sign button between the Steps.

This will show you a list of available Steps in our __Step Library__.
You can search and filter these steps if you want to, or just browse through the collection.

Adding a Step is as easy as clicking the `Add to Workflow` button
in this Step Library popup.

Once it's added to your Workflow, you can __Drag and Drop__ to reorder your list of Steps.

Once you're happy with your Workflow you should click the `Save` button on the left side.
That's all, your next build will automatically use the current saved Workflow!
