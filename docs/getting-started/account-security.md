## Enable Two-factor authentication

We provide an extra layer of security if you enable Two-factor authentication (TFA) on your Bitrise account.

1. Download and install [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447?hl=en) on your phone.

1. Log in to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) and go to your `Profile`.

2. Click `Account settings`.

3. Scroll down and click `Security` on the left.

4. Click on `Enable` under `Two-factor authentication`.

5. Open your Google Authenticator and scan the QR-code that appears on your screen.

6. Enter the 6-digit code that was generated.

    !!! tip "TFA on GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab and Xamarin"
        We recommend that you check your connected accounts (GitHub, Bitbucket, GitLab and Xamarin) and enable TFAs if you haven't already.

7. Once you have activated your TFA and saved your recovery codes, you will receive a confirmation email from `letsconnect@bitrise.io`.

## Generate personal access tokens manually

There are two types of personal access tokens in your `Security` tab of your profile:

- the `auto-generated` ones, which are generated by Bitrise automatically whenever communicating with the Bitrise API

- the `user-generated` ones which you can manually generate for yourself

Follow the steps to create a new token manually!

1. In your `Security` tab, click on `Generate new`.

2. Fill out the `Token description` field and select the appropriate expiration time (1 hour, 1 day, 1 month or never) for your token.

3. Click `Save & Continue`.

4. In the `Personal Access token` pop-up window, you can see your newly generated token. Save it somewhere safe now so that you can use it later.

5. Click `Done`.

In your `Security` page, now you can see all your tokens with their expiration date and with the option to `Edit` or `Remove` them.
