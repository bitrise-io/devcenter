Secrets can be accessed and used in a similar way as App Env Vars,
the main difference is that __secrets are not stored as part of the build configuration__.

When you run a build locally, with the Bitrise CLI, the secrets are read from
a `.bitrise.secrets.yml` file, which is expected to be in the same directory
where the `bitrise.yml` is, and where you run the `bitrise run` command.

If you want to store your secrets somewhere else, you can specify
the location of the secrets file with the `--inventory` flag of the `bitrise run` command,
e.g. `bitrise run my-workflow --inventory /path/to/secrets.yml`.

!!! warning "Make sure to `gitignore` your secrets file!"
    As a best practice, you should always make sure that the `.bitrise.secrets.yml`
    is added to your `.gitignore`, so that it will never be committed into your
    repository! The best is if you `gitignore` everything what
    starts with `.bitrise`, which can be done by adding the
    line: `.bitrise*` to your `.gitignore` file.

The format of the secrets YAML file is really simple. It has to include
a root `envs:` item and then the list of environment variables.

Example:

```yaml
envs:
- SECRET_ENV_ONE: first secret value
- SECRET_ENV_TWO: second secret value
```

The environment variables defined in the secrets file can be used
just like any other environment variable, so, if you save the above
example into a `.bitrise.secrets.yml` file, and you have a `bitrise.yml`
file in the same directory with the content:

```yaml
format_version: 1.3.1
default_step_lib_source: https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib.git

workflows:
  test:
    steps:
    - script@1.1.3:
        inputs:
        - content: |
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "SECRET_ENV_ONE: ${SECRET_ENV_ONE}"
            echo "SECRET_ENV_TWO: ${SECRET_ENV_TWO}"
```

You can just `bitrise run test` in the directory, and you'll see that the Script
step will print the values specified in the secrets file:

```

As Secrets are the first environment variables processed when you execute
a `bitrise run` command, you can use the environment variables everywhere in
your `bitrise.yml`, for example in `App Env Vars` (`app: envs:` in the [bitrise.yml](/bitrise-cli/basics-of-bitrise-yml/)),
[Workflow environment variables](/bitrise-cli/workflows/#define-workflow-specific-parameters-environment-variables)
and Step inputs too.
