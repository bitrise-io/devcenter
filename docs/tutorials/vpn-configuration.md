Do you require a VPN connection for your build, to be able to connect to your server,
either to `git clone` your repository or to access a private API?
If yes, then this tutorial is for you!


## Technical infos

Connecting to a VPN, in short, works like this:

1. the build starts
1. you install & configure the VPN components you need
1. you start the VPN
1. you proceed with the build

Obviously, if you require a VPN connection in order to access your code repository,
you have to connect to the VPN __before__ the `Git Clone` step, but in general
you can configure & connect to the VPN anywhere in your Workflow, __before__ you'd use the
connection.

_You can choose other VPN tools, not just the one shown here ([strongswan](https://www.strongswan.org)),
this is just one example setup which works on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io)._

__One important note__: when you choose your VPN tool and do the setup/configuration,
you have to be careful to __not to restart / abort__ existing SSH sessions!
The [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) workers will abort the build
if the SSH connection between the build's Control/Master machine and
the Build virtual machine terminates!


## Example

This is an example script which you can either save into your repository and run
it from there, or just copy paste its content into a `Script Step` in your `bitrise`
configuration (`bitrise.yml` / Workflow).

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

echo "WAN IP"
# This prints the servers Internet IP adress to the log, useful for debugging
curl http://httpbin.org/ip

case "$OSTYPE" in
  linux*)
    echo "Configuring for Linux"

    # Variables
    etc_dir=/etc
    etc_sudo='sudo' # Sudo is needed for Linux Strongswan configuration

    # Install strongswan
    echo "Installing Strongswan..."
    sudo apt-get install -y strongswan

    ;;

    echo "Configuring for Mac OS"
