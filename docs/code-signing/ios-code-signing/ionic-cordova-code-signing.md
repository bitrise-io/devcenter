Naturally, Bitrise supports iOS applications built with either __Ionic__ or __Cordova__. However, the code signing process is slightly different compared to a "native" Xcode project.

Bitrise supports both manual and automatic provisioning for Ionic and Cordova apps as well - and once again, the processes are somewhat different.

### Ionic/Cordova code signing with manual provisioning

1. Generate the native Xcode project locally from your Ionic or Cordova project by calling `cordova platform add ios` or `ionic cordova platform add ios`.

1. Use our `codesigndoc` tool to [collect the code signing files](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/code-signing/ios-code-signing/collecting-files-with-codesigndoc/).
1. Upload the files to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

    You can do this either on the website UI or with the `codesigndoc` tool itself.

1. Make sure you have the `Certificate and profile installer` step in your workflow.

1. Add the `Generate cordova build configuration` step to your Workflow. It must come after the `Certificate and profile installer` step.

1. Fill in the required input for the step. Please note that both the `Code Signing Identity` and the `Provisioning Profile` are required inputs for iOS apps even though they are not marked as such.

    - `Build configuration`: you can set it to either `debug` or `release`.
    - `Code Sign Identity`: enter a Developer or a Distribution identity.
    - `Provisioning Profile`: enter the appropriate Provisioning Profile.
    - `Packaging Type`: this controls what type of build is generated by Xcode. Set the type of code signing you need.

1. Add the `Cordova archive` or the `Ionic archive` step to your workflow and fill in the required inputs.

    This step must come after the `Generate cordova build configuration` step in the workflow.

1. Run your build!  

### Ionic/Cordova code signing with auto provisioning

1. Make sure you have your .p12 signing certificates uploaded to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

1. Add the `Cordova prepare` or the `Ionic prepare` step to your Workflow. These steps call the `platform rm` and `platform add` commands.

1. Add the `iOS Auto Provision` step to your workflow. Please make sure it's the latest version!

    The step will export:

      - the project's development team
      - the installed codesign identity's name
      - the installed provisioning profile.

    These will be used by the `Generate cordova build configuration` step.

    !!! warning "Do not use both code signing steps in your workflow"
        If you have both the `Certificate and profile installer` and the `iOS Auto Provisioning` steps in your workflow, your build will fail.

1. Add the `Generate cordova build configuration` step to your Workflow.

1. Add the `Cordova Archive` or the `Ionic Archive` step to your workflow.

1. Set the `Should remove platforms as prepare step?` to `false`. This is crucial: it ensures the step will not remove and re-add the platform of the native projects generated in the `Cordova prepare` or the `Ionic prepare`.

1. Run your build!
