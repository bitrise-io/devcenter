## Protecting your code signing files

You can set your code signing files to `Protected` mode: this means they cannot be downloaded from your [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) account. Your builds will be able to use these protected files, of course. But if you make the file protected, no one will be able to reveal it and the only way to overwrite it is by deleting the current one and creating a new one.

1. Select your App on your `Dashboard`.

1. Select the `Workflow` tab.

1. Select the `Code Signing` tab.

1. Locate the file you wish to make protected and open the dropdown menu.

1. Select the `Make protected` option.

   A pop-up window will warn you that this change is irreversible once you confirm it. You do not need to separately save your changes.

Once you are done, your only option in the file's dropdown menu will be `Delete`.
