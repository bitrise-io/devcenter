## Interactive available Environment Variables list

In the `Workflow Editor` on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io)
you can click into any input field of a Step and a green `Insert Variable` button will appear.

Click this button and you'll get a full list of available Environment Variables.
You can search in this list, and when you find the one you're looking for just click it,
and it'll be inserted into the input field for you.

This is an interactive list, which includes Environment Variables generated by previous Steps!
This means, that if you click into an input of the third Step of your Workflow,
the list will include all the Environment Variables (outputs) generated by the first and second Steps,
but not the ones which will be generated by the forth, fifth, ... Steps.

## Exposed by the Bitrise CLI

These Environment Variables are available everywhere, even if you run the build on your own Mac
(using the [Bitrise CLI](https://www.bitrise.io/cli)):

* `BITRISE_TRIGGERED_WORKFLOW_ID` : the Workflow's ID which was triggered, either with `bitrise run` or `bitrise trigger`
* `BITRISE_TRIGGERED_WORKFLOW_TITLE` : the Workflow's title (if you provided one) which was triggered,
  either with `bitrise run` or `bitrise trigger`
* `BITRISE_BUILD_STATUS` : current status of the build - `"0"` if there are no failed steps yet,
  `"1"` if there's at least one failed step
* `BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR` : path of source / base workdir. By default it's the directory where `bitrise` runs
  (e.g. your repository root), unless you provide a different value.
  Can be overwritten during the build, which will change the working directory for subsequent Steps in the build.
* `BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR` : directory to store artifacts / files for deploy.
  It's a temporary directory created by `bitrise` CLI by default, and can be overwritten before starting `bitrise` CLI.
  _The content of this directory can be attached to the [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) build page, as artifacts,
  with the `Deploy to Bitrise.io` step for example._
* `CI` : indicates whether `bitrise` CLI is running in CI (Continuous Integration) mode. Value can be `"true"` or `"false"`.
* `PR` : indicates whether `bitrise` CLI is running in PR (Pull Request) mode. Value can be `"true"` or `"false"`.
