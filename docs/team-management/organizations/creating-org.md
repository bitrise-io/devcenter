You can create and manage __Organizations__ on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) to manage entire teams quickly and effectively. You can set up multiple groups within an organization for different projects - for example, you can have a _Developer_ group and a _Tester_ group assigned to different app. You can also set roles for your group: these roles determine the access rights provided to members of the group.

To run builds as an organization, you need to subscribe to an __Organization__ plan.

## Creating an organization

No need for lengthy preparation when you wish to create an organization on Bitrise: all you really need is an existing Bitrise account - this will be the default owner of the organization - and an organization name. You can set up everything else later!

1. Log in to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

1. On the top menu bar, find the `+` symbol and click it.

1. Choose `Add organization` from the dropdown menu.

      Alternatively, you can create a new organization from:
      - your `Account settings` page: find the `+ New Organization` option on the left.
      - on the `Apps` screen: open the dropdown menu above your apps and click `Create organization`.

        You need to subscribe to an __Organization__ plan to be able to run builds.

1. Transfer apps to your organization.

    You can skip this step and transfer your apps or add new apps to your organization at any time.
