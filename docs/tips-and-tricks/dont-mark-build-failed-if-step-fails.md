*To do this you have to switch to `bitrise.yml` mode (open the Workflow Editor on bitrise.io -> left side: click on `bitrise.yml` to switch to the interactive `bitrise.yml` editor).*

All you have to do is: add an `is_skippable: true` flag to the Step.

An example `script` step which, although fails, it won't "break" the build:

```
- script:
    is_skippable: true
    inputs:
    - content: |-
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Failing Step."
        exit 1
        # exit 1 would mark this step as Failed, but it won't break the Build
        #  because of the is_skippable: true flag / property
```
