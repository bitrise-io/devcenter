There are many ways you can manage the Code Signing of iOS projects.
In short, all you need for signing an iOS app is:

* `.p12` Certificate / Identity file(s)
* __Provisioning Profile__ file(s) matching your project (team ID, bundle ID, ...)
* And a script, tool or step which installs these files in the build environment.
  __If you want to store your code signing files on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io),
  please make sure that you have the `Certificate and profile installer` step in your
  app's workflow!__


## Use bitrise.io and our tools to manage your code signing files

If you use [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) to store your code signing files,
creating a signed iOS `.ipa` (iOS app file) is as simple as:

1. [Collect the required files with codesigndoc](#collect-the-required-files-with-codesigndoc)
1. Make sure the `Certificate and profile installer` step is in your Workflow (that's
   our step which can download & install the code signing files from [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io))
1. Use the `Xcode Archive` or `Xamarin Archive` steps to create a signed `.ipa`
    * Xcode projects: [Configure `Xcode Archive` to create the signed `.ipa`](#configure-xcode-archive-to-create-the-signed-ipa)
    * Xamarin projects: [Configure `Xamarin Archive` to create the signed `.ipa`](#configure-xamarin-archive-to-create-the-signed-ipa)


### Collect the required files with codesigndoc

The easiest way to collect these files is to use our open source [codesigndoc](https://github.com/bitrise-tools/codesigndoc)
tool. This tool runs a clean Archive _on your Mac_, and analyzes the Xcode log output
to see which code signing files Xcode used during the Archive.

You can run `codesigndoc` with the [one liner you can find in its Readme](https://github.com/bitrise-tools/codesigndoc#one-liner).

!!! note "Separate one-liners for Xcode and Xamarin projects"
    There are two one-liners, one for __Xcode__ projects, and one for __Xamarin__ (iOS) projects.
    Make sure you use the right one!

!!! note "Troubleshooting: Ensure the sate of the code"
    You get the most accurate result if you run `codesigndoc` on the same state of your
    repository/code which is available after a clean `git clone`, as that will
    be the state of the code after the build server checks out the code (e.g.
    you might have files on your Mac which are in `.gitignore`, so it exists
    on your Mac but not in the repository / after a `git clone` on a new Mac).

    So, for the best result, you should __do a clean `git clone` of the
    repository__ (into a new directory) on your Mac, and then
    run `codesigndoc` in this directory (not in the directory where
    you usually work on the project).

!!! note "Troubleshooting: make sure you can export an IPA from Xcode.app"
    It's also advised to do a full Archive + Export (until you get a signed `.ipa`)
    of your project from `Xcode.app` first, and run `codesigndoc` __after that__.
    The reason is that `Xcode.app` might download or update profiles in the background
    during the IPA export. If you run `codesigndoc` after you exported an `.ipa`
    from Xcode, `codesigndoc` will able to collect all the files.

Once you have the `.p12` and Provisioning Profiles collected by `codesigndoc`,
upload these files to your app on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

__Code signing files can be uploaded to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) in the app's Workflow Editor__,
under the `Code signing & Files` section of the editor.

There's only one more thing you have to do: if you want to store your code signing files on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io),
__please make sure that you have the `Certificate and profile installer` step in your app's workflow!__
That's the step which downloads and installs the Certificate (.p12) file(s) and
the Provisioning Profile file(s) from [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

!!! note "Troubleshooting: missing Distribution signing files"
    If `codesigndoc` would not pick up one or more distribution .p12 / Provisioning Profile,
    you can export those manually (.p12 from `Keychain Access` app, Provisioning Profiles from
    [Apple Developer Portal](https://developer.apple.com/)), just like you would when you
    transfer these files between Macs.

    But, __even if `codesigndoc` would not find
    all the files, you should upload all the files collected by `codesigndoc`!__
    The base files collected by `codesigndoc` are essential for your project's
    code signing, without those it's not possible to create a signed IPA
    for the project!

### Configure Xcode Archive to create the signed IPA

Once you have all your code signing files [collected](#collect-the-required-files-with-codesigndoc),
and you have the `Certificate and profile installer` and the `Xcode Archive` steps in the workflow,
you can start a build and get a signed IPA.

If you use Xcode 8 automatic code signing, the generated IPA by default will be a development signed IPA.
If you use Manual code signing, the default code signing type will be what you set in your
Xcode project for the Scheme/Configuration.

To specify a distribution code signing type, all you have to do is:

1. select the `Xcode Archive for iOS` (or in case of a Mac app, the `Xcode Archive for Mac`) step in the app's Workflow Editor
1. set the `Select method for export` input of the step to the type of code signing you want to use (`app-store`, `ad-hoc`, `enterprise`, ...)
1. save the Workflow, and start a new build

That's all. Xcode will auto select the right signing files based on your project's Bundle ID and
Team ID settings, and the Export Method you set.

If you want to sign the IPA with a different team's code signing files (e.g.
if you use your company's code signing for internal builds, but your client's
code signing files for App Store distribution), all you have to do is to set
the `The Developer Portal team to use for this export` option as well (in addition
to the `Select method for export`).


### Configure Xamarin Archive to create the signed IPA

Once you have all your code signing files [collected](#collect-the-required-files-with-codesigndoc),
and you have the `Certificate and profile installer` and the `Xamarin Archive` steps in the workflow,
you can start a build and get a signed IPA.

To control what kind of code signing the IPA should be signed with, all you have to do is:

1. select the `Xamarin Archive` step in the app's Workflow Editor
1. set the `Xamarin solution configuration` input to the Xamarin project Configuration you want to use (e.g. `Release`)
1. set the `Xamarin solution platform` input to `iPhone`

You can control the code signing type in your Xamarin project, by settings the
code signing configurations for the Configuration in Xamarin Studio.

_If you want to use more than one code signing type (e.g. to create both Ad Hoc and App Store
signed apps), you should create more than one Release configuration in Xamarin Studio,
and set the separate configurations to the types you want to use (e.g. one to Ad Hoc,
and the second one to App Store)._

!!! note "Tip: Copy/clone an existing Release configuration"
    You can `Copy` the existing
    `Release` configuration in Xamarin Studio, to have an identical base configuration,
    where you only change the code signing settings. For example,
    `Copy` the `Release|iPhone` configuration with the name `ReleaseAppStore`,
    set the code signing to App Store for this `ReleaseAppStore` configuration,
    and specify this configuration as the `Xamarin solution configuration`
    input of the `Xamarin Archive` step.

    _Note: Don't forget to run `codesigndoc` again if you change code signing
    configurations in your Xamarin project, or to manually collect
    and upload the signing files required for the configurations
    you want to use!_


## Use a third party tool to manage your code signing files

There are third party tools which can be used for managing your code signing files,
like [fastlane match](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/match) -
related bitrise.io setup guide: [How to configure fastlane match for Bitrise](/fastlane/how-to-configure-fastlane-match-for-bitrise/) -
or [fastlane sigh](https://github.com/fastlane/fastlane/tree/master/sigh).

!!! warning
    If you decide to use a third party tool for code signing management,
    please consult the tool's documentation and issue tracker,
    we only provide customer support for our own Step (`Certificate and profile installer`)
    and tools (`codesigndoc`)!

!!! note "`Certificate and profile installer` step"
    Even if you use a third party tool to manage your code signing files,
    and you don't plan to upload any code signing file to bitrise.io,
    you should keep the `Certificate and profile installer` step in your
    Workflow. This is because certain tools were not designed to work
    in an ephemeral environment, or in a full clean macOS install,
    and the `Certificate and profile installer` includes common
    workarounds for this situation. It's not guaranteed that it will help with
    the tool of your choice, but it won't cause any issue either.
