Same thing why code libraries / Pods etc are awesome:
You have a single code which can be updated independently from other parts.
You don't have to maintain it, but you can change it, or use your own.

We also push features with steps instead of building it into the core tool,
for faster and versioned experiments, updating the parts independently,
and providing a way for you to upgrade when it's appropriate for you.

If a new version doesn't work for you, you can always go back to a previous one.

We try to maintain compatibility, so older versions can work too.
