On Bitrise, we have `OS X` and `Linux` virtual machines hosted for your builds.
You can select multiple stacks that holds different versions of these virtual machines.
Read more about available stacks and stack prepare types in the [Available Stacks docs](doc:available-stacks).

## Security

Every build runs in its own virtual machine and the virtual machine is rolled back to a saved state, the base box state, after the build is finished. This way **your builds are always protected** by changes made by others and by your previous builds and you can use a **stable environment** to define your build workflow, since *no state persists between builds*.

!!! note "Passwordless sudo"
    The user which is used for the builds is configured with **passwordless sudo** enabled, this way you are able to install all the extra things you need for your builds and for other automation.

## Customization

You can find the **OS X** base box setup guide and automation scripts we use for building our OS X virtual machine base box in our [OS X Box Bootstrap repository](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap). This way you are able to build your own virtual machine based on the ones used on Bitrise to match ours.

For our **Linux** machines, check out the [Bitrise Base Docker Image's repository](https://github.com/bitrise-docker/bitrise-base).

!!! note "System reports"
    You can always check our current configurations in the [system reports folder of our main repository](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/tree/master/system_reports).

    These reports have been generated by the scripts indicated in the first lines of the report itself.

## Open Source Stacks

The repositories for our virtual machines are also the place for pull requests. If you'd like to have a tool pre-installed in our machines, feel free to add your changes and they will be included in the next release after merge.

## Virtual machine updates

Updates are always announced on our [News Blog](http://blog.bitrise.io/) and can be seen on [your Bitrise Dashboard](https://www.bitrise.io/dashboard). We will also send you a *Platform Updates* email about significant changes, unless you disable this feature under your [account settings page](https://www.bitrise.io/me/profile).

### Minor updates

Additional patches might be applied during the week in case we detect an issue with the current virtual machine environments. These patches do not change any pre-installed tool's version, unless it's really necessary.

## Xcode version support guideline

We have several setups available with different Xcode versions. The Xcode you have pre-installed in your dedicated VM is always the one specified in your app's Settings under the Stack selector menu. You are able to switch between Xcode versions with changing this setting. Read more about available stacks and stack prepare types in the [Available Stacks docs](http://devcenter.bitrise.io/v2.0/docs/available-stacks#section-os-x).

When a new major version of Xcode gets released we keep supporting the previous major version until the first significant patch version of Xcode is released.

As an example in case of Xcode major version 6: Xcode 6 is the major version and the first significant patch is Xcode 6.1. We kept the latest Xcode 5 installed on the Virtual Machines until Xcode 6.1 was released.

### iOS Simulator version & SDK support

All the iOS Simulator versions which can be installed through *Xcode -> Preferences -> Downloads* are installed and available.

### xctool support

[xctool](https://github.com/facebook/xctool) is pre-installed on the OS X VMs, through [homebrew](http://brew.sh/). If you need to update it to be sure you have the latest version you can add a [Script Step](https://github.com/bitrise-io/steps-script) with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
brew update && brew upgrade xctool
```

If you need the latest `xctool` version compiled from source you can do it by adding a **Script Step** to your workflow, right before your first Xcode build, Analyze, Unit test or Archive step, with the following content:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
brew update && brew uninstall xctool && brew install xctool --build-from-source
```
