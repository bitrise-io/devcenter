If you press the `Authorize application` button, you will be redirected to Bitrise.

## Finish signup

You will have to pick a username and a password for your Bitrise account. This way you are free from relying on the given service's availability, you are also able to connect more accounts, GitHub **and** Bitbucket, for example. Last, but not least, you don't have to stick to your connected account's username.
