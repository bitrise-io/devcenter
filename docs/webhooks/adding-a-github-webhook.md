You can specify webhooks so that Bitrise automatically triggers a build of your app whenever you perform a specified action, such as a code push or a pull request. For GitHub, all you have to do is register your `bitrise-webhooks` URL as a Webhook in your [GitHub](https://www.github.com) repository.

You can register a webhook either automatically or manually. This guide walks you through the process of __manually__ registering a webhook. [Read more about automatic webhook registration](/webhooks/#setting-up-incoming-webhooks-automatically).  

## Get the webhook URL for GitHub
