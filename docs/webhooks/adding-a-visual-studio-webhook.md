You can set up webhooks so that Bitrise automatically triggers a build of your app whenever you perform a specified action, such as a code push or a pull request. For Visual Studio, all you have to do is register your `bitrise-webhooks` URL for
a [visualstudio.com](https://visualstudio.com) *project* as a `Service Hooks` integration.

You can find an official guide
on [visualstudio.com 's documentations site](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/get-started/integrate/service-hooks/webhooks-and-vso-vs).

## Get the webhook URL for Visual Studio

1. Navigate to the `Code` tab of your app's page and select `Visual Studio Online / Visual Studio Team Services` from the dropdown menu of the `Incoming Webhooks` section.

    * In the `Filters` section select the `Repository` you want to integrate.
    * You can leave the other filters on default.
    * Click `Next`.
    * On the `Action` setup form enter the `bitrise-webhooks` URL (`.../h/visualstudio/BITRISE-APP-SLUG/BITRISE-APP-API-TOKEN`) in the `URL` field. You can leave every other option on default.

1. Click `Finish`

That's all! The next time you __push code__ or __push a new tag__
a build will be triggered (if you have Trigger mapping defined for the event(s) on Bitrise).
