To have Bitrise automatically start a build every time you push code into your repository you
can set up a webhook at your code hosting service which will automatically
trigger a build on Bitrise with the code you push to your repository.

You can register a webhook either automatically or manually. This guide walks you through the process of __manually__ registering a webhook. [Read more about automatic webhook registration](/webhooks/#setting-up-incoming-webhooks-automatically).
