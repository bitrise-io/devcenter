You can set up webhooks so that Bitrise automatically triggers a build of your app whenever you perform a specified action, such as a code push or a pull request. For Deveo, all you have to do is register your `bitrise-webhooks` URL for
a [Deveo](https://deveo.com) repository.

## Get the webhook URL for Deveo

1. Navigate to the `Code` tab of your app's page and select `Deveo` from the dropdown menu of the `Incoming Webhooks` section.

6. Type `json` in the `Content type` field.

6. Click `Save hook`.

That's all! The next time you __push code__ or __push a new tag__
a build will be triggered (if you have Trigger mapping defined for the event(s) on Bitrise).
