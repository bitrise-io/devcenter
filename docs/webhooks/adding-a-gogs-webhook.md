You can set up webhooks so that Bitrise automatically triggers a build of your app whenever you perform a specified action. For Gogs, all you have to do is register your `bitrise-webhooks` URL as a Webhook in your [Gogs](https://gogs.io) repository.

## Get the webhook URL for Gogs

1. Navigate to the `Code` tab of your app's page and select `Gogs` from the dropdown menu of the `Incoming Webhooks` section.
