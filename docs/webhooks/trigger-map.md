Now that you have a [webhook registered](/webhooks/),
the next step is to define when to build what.

When you register a webhook for an event or for multiple events (e.g. for `Code Push` and
for `Pull Request` events), your source code hosting service will call the webhook
every time the related event happens.

On [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) these webhooks calls are called "triggers",
and can be mapped to different `Workflows`, or not mapped at all.
If you don't map a trigger to any workflow, then [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) won't
start a build. If you map it to a workflow, then a build will be started
with the selected workflow.

In the following examples we'll use a very simple Bitrise configuration (`bitrise.yml`),
which does nothing else just prints the selected workflow's ID:

```yaml
---
format_version: 1.3.0
default_step_lib_source: https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib.git
trigger_map:
- push_branch: "*"
  workflow: primary
- pull_request_target_branch: "*"
  pull_request_source_branch: "*"
  workflow: primary
workflows:
  primary:
    steps:
    - script:
        inputs:
        - content: |-
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "$BITRISE_TRIGGERED_WORKFLOW_ID"
```

!!! note "What is bitrise.yml?"
    `bitrise.yml` is the representation of your app's configuration.
    In the workflow editor you can edit it in a visual way through the web UI,
    but you can always switch to `bitrise.yml` mode (left side of the workflow editor)
    to see the configuration in a YAML format, as well as you can edit the configuration
    in YAML format too. It's up to you which solution you prefer, the visual web UI
    or the YAML (`bitrise.yml`) representation, and you can switch between the two
    any time (the changes you do in the web UI will be reflected in the `bitrise.yml`,
    and vice versa).

The above example `bitrise.yml` will select the `primary` branch for every Code Push (`push_branch`)
and for every Pull Request (`pull_request_target_branch`).

_If you remove the pull request item_ from the `trigger_map` list, then
no pull request will trigger a build anymore. Example:

```yaml
trigger_map:
- push_branch: "*"
  workflow: primary
```

This configuration will start a build with the `primary` workflow
for every code push, but for nothing else (e.g. not for pull requests).

## "Components" of the `trigger_map`

A `trigger_map` is a _list of filters_, and the `workflow` the given
filters should select in case of a matching trigger.

__Every filter item has to include at least one condition!__

This means that you can't have an item which only specifies the `workflow`,
at least one filter (`push_branch` / `pull_request_source_branch` / `pull_request_target_branch`)
has to be specified!

### The available filters:

- `push_branch` : A filter which is matched against Code Push events' "branch" parameter
- `pull_request_source_branch` : A filter which is matched against Pull Request events' "source branch"
  parameter (the branch the pull request was started from)
- `pull_request_target_branch` : A filter which is matched against Pull Request events' "target branch"
  parameter - the branch the pull request will be __merged into__
- `pattern` : __DEPRECATED__ - this filter was used for both code push and pull request events,
  in combination with `is_pull_request_allowed`. This filter is now deprecated,
  as the new filters allow better control over event mapping.

If you define multiple filters in a single item then __all filters have to match__
in order to select that item's workflow.
For example:

```
trigger_map:
- pull_request_target_branch: "master"
  pull_request_source_branch: "develop"
  workflow: primary
```

will only select the `primary` workflow if the pull request's source branch is `develop` __AND__
the target branch is `master`.

If you want to specify filters which should be treated separately, e.g. to
select `primary` for pull requests where the source is `develop`, as well as select
for the ones which target `master`:

```
trigger_map:
- pull_request_target_branch: "master"
  workflow: primary
- pull_request_source_branch: "develop"
  workflow: primary
```

One last note, which is hopefully not surprising after the previous example:
you can't mix and match `push_branch` and the `pull_request_..` filters in the same
item. This would effectively mean that the workflow should be selected
if the event is a Code Push and a Pull Request event __at the same time__.
This is simply not possible, source code hosting services send separate
webhooks for Pull Request (pre-merge state) and for Code Push events.
_A single webhook event will never be Code Push and Pull Request at the same time._


## How to build only a single branch

If you want to build only a single branch, for every code push, but for nothing else (no push to
any other branch should trigger a build, nor any pull request), then
all you have to do is to specify a `trigger_map` which does not map anything else
to any workflow, only the branch you want to build.

E.g. if you only want to build the `master` branch on code push:

```yaml
trigger_map:
- push_branch: master
  workflow: primary
```

Or if you only want to build `feature/` branches:

```yaml
trigger_map:
- push_branch: feature/*
  workflow: primary
```

Or the two together:

```yaml
trigger_map:
- push_branch: master
  workflow: primary
- push_branch: feature/*
  workflow: primary
```

This configuration will start a build for every code push which happens on
either `master` or on a `feature/` branch, and will use the same workflow for
both (`primary`).

If you want to use a differentn workflow for your `master` branch, then
all you have to do is to change the `workflow:` for that trigger map item:

```yaml
trigger_map:
- push_branch: master
  workflow: deploy
- push_branch: feature/*
  workflow: primary
```

This configuration will use the workflow `deploy` for every code push on `master`,
and the workflow `primary` for every code push on `feature/` branches,
and __will not start a build for anything else__.


## A very simple, two-workflow CI/CD setup

A base CI/CD setup involves two workflows: one for integration tests,
and one for distribution.

If you have a workflow `primary` for doing the integration tests,
and `deploy` to do the deployment / distribution, and you want to
run the integration test for code pushes and pull requests on every branch
except the `master` branch, which should instead use the `deploy` workflow:

```yaml
trigger_map:
- push_branch: master
  workflow: deploy
- push_branch: "*"
  workflow: primary
- pull_request_target_branch: "*"
  workflow: primary
```

!!! warning "Order of the items matter!"
    When `bitrise` receives a webhook event (any kind) it'll match it against
    the app's `trigger_map`. __The first item it matches will select the workflow for the build!__

This means that if you'd specify the `push_branch: master` __after__ the
`push_branch: "*"` item, `master` would never be selected as every code push
event would match `push_branch: "*"` first!

### Don't start two builds for pull requests from the same repository

When you start a Pull Request from the same repository (not from a fork,
just from a branch of the repository),
__the source code hosting service will send two webhooks__,
one for the code push and one for the pull request!

An important note: although it might seem like both builds are the same,
it might not be! The code push event/build builds the code
of the branch, without any merging, etc. It builds the exact same state of the code
what you have when you checkout that branch.
The Pull Request build on the other hand builds a "pre-merged" state of the code,
which is expected to be the state of the code __after__ you merged the pull request.

Whether you want to build both or just one of these in case of a pull request
is up to you and depends on your project's requirements, but with `bitrise`
you can decide whether you want it or not.

!!! note "Code merge is treated as Code Push!"
    Source code hosting services treat the event of "merge" as a code push
    event. For example if you merge a Pull Request from `feature/a` into `master`,
    when you merge the PR it will generate a code push to `master`.

An example to build only the pull request ("pre-merged") events/state,
in addition to deploying `master`:

```yaml
trigger_map:
- push_branch: master
  workflow: deploy
- pull_request_target_branch: "*"
  workflow: primary
```

or if you don't want to start a build for pull requests, only for code push events:

```yaml
trigger_map:
- push_branch: master
  workflow: deploy
- push_branch: "*"
  workflow: primary
```

## How to build only pull requests

If all you want is to run integration tests for pull requests, and you
don't want to do anything else, then you can use a trigger map configuration
like this:

```yaml
trigger_map:
- pull_request_target_branch: "*"
  workflow: primary
```

This will select the `primary` workflow for every and any pull request,
and will not start a build for anything else.

If you'd only want to build pull requests which are targeted to
be merged into `master`, the configuration would look like this:

```yaml
trigger_map:
- pull_request_target_branch: master
  workflow: primary
```

## Troubleshooting

__Debugging - what happens with webhooks related to un-mapped branches__

You can't limit Webhooks by branch in most of the services,
so [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) will still receive a webhook call for every code push of other branches,
but it won't start a build unless it finds a matching filter in the `trigger_map`,
which specifies a `workflow` to be selected for the build.
_This is also true if you use the __Build Trigger API__ directly._

You can see all the ignored calls on your [Activity page on bitrise.io](http://www.bitrise.io/activity).

An ignored build call entry in the Activity list looks like:

```
Build trigger failed: trigger-pattern (push_branch:) (pr_source_branch:prtest/t1) (pr_target_branch:develop) did not match any defined workflow in trigger_map
PROJECT-NAME - Run triggered with params: push-branch: , pr-source-branch: prtest/t1, pr-target-branch: develop, but no matching workflow found
```

Bitrise returns the reason to the source code hosting service (the service which sent the webhook) too,
so if your service has a webhook history (e.g. GitHub, Bitbucket, ...)
you can see the reason why a given webhook did not trigger a build there too!

Simply open the webhook history on your source code hosting service,
and check the response Bitrise returned. It will be something like:

```
{"success_responses":[],"failed_responses":[{"status":"error","message":"trigger pattern did not match any defined mapping: Run triggered with params: push-branch: , pr-source-branch: prtest/t1, pr-target-branch: develop, but no matching workflow found","service":"bitrise","slug":"...","build_slug":"","build_number":0,"build_url":"","triggered_workflow":""}]}
```

_These detailed responses are only generated if you use
the new [hooks.bitrise.io](https://hooks.bitrise.io) webhook URL!
Initially we had a non open source `bitrise.io/hooks` endpoint
for webhooks, but every new project registered should now get the new
`hooks.bitrise.io` webhook URL automatically. If your webhook
would still be a `bitrise.io/hook` URL, please replace it with the new
`hooks.bitrise.io/` URL - you can find this on the `Code` tab of your app!_

### Local debugging

You can also test which workflow will be selected for a trigger
using our [open source, Bitrise CLI](https://www.bitrise.io/cli).

To simulate a code push, you can run:

```
bitrise trigger-check --push-branch master
```

To simulate a Pull Request, you can run:

```
bitrise trigger-check --pr-source-branch=feature/a --pr-target-branch=master
```

For more information and options run:

```
bitrise trigger-check --help
```
