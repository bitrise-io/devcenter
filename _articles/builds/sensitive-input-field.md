Any sensitive information such as passwords, IDs, and API tokens are exposed in the build logs/bitrise.yml of your public apps, hence visible to anyone who has the build URL of the app. You can hide these inputs with **secret environment variables (env vars)** so that those are not available in build logs/bitrise.yml.
To make the sensitive input fields obvious in our Workflow Editor, we've marked them with a yellow `SENSITIVE` label in steps holding sensitive input fields. **These inputs must be defined with the help of secret env vars and not with env vars!**

You can hide any input of your choice with secret env vars even if the field is not labeled `SENSITIVE` but **you must use secret env vars for fields which are by default marked as `SENSITIVE`**.

There are two ways to define secret env vars:

- directly [in the steps](/sensitive-input-field/#set-a-sensitive-input-in-a-step/)
- in the [`Secrets` tab](/builds/env-vars-secret-env-vars/#about-secrets/) of your Workflow Editor and select the secret env var in a step input when needed.

Head over to [Secrets and Env Vars](/builds/env-vars-secret-env-vars/) to find out the difference between `Env Vars` and `Secrets`!

## Set a sensitive input in a step

1. Click the `Select Secret Variable` button below the input field which is marked with the yellow `SENSITIVE` label.

2. In the `Insert variable` pop-up, browse the `Choose Secret Env Var` list or create a new secret env var (add the key and the value) in the `Create New Secret Env Var` section.

    !!! warning "`Expose for Pull Requests` toggle is disabled in public apps"
        The `Expose for Pull Requests?` toggle under the `Value` field is by default disabled and cannot be enabled with public apps to **protect the secrets of your public app in the case of pull requests**.

3. Hit `Add`.

    The new secret env var will be available in the `Choose Secret Env Var` list or under the `Secrets` tab for your app.

    If you wish to delete your input or keep this field empty, click the red `x`.

The selected or newly created secret env var will get automatically saved into the input field of the step.

!!! warning "Secret env vars"
    * Note that you cannot modify the input manually in the input field marked with the `SENSITIVE` label! Instead, click on the field and then click the `Select secret variable` to **replace** the existing input with another secret env var from the list or to **create a new one** in the `Insert variable` pop-up.
    * **Do not add private information in the `Env Var` tab**! Our `Secret` tab is designed to hold encrypted inputs as secret env vars which will not be exposed in `bitrise.yml` or in public app PRs.
    * Note that secret env vars can only hide sensitive information **in the build logs of your public app**. If you **attach any other file to your build log** which contains sensitive information but it is not encrypted, then sensitive information will be visible to anyone who has the build URL!
