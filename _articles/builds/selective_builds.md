The Selective Builds setting provides change detection for your builds. Enabling it allows you to only trigger a build of an app if certain files or folders have changed.

You may want to use this setting if:

* you have multiple apps in a single repository
* multiple apps share common files in your repository

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Selective Builds with non-Github projects" content=" The current version of our Selective Builds feature only works with GitHub projects. If your repository is hosted by another git hosting service, the option will not be available."%} 

The appropriate Service credential user must be set on your app's `Team` page. This user must have an admin right for the GitHub repository of the project. [Read more about setting up the Service credential user](/troubleshooting/github-pull-request-status-troubleshooting/#make-sure-to-select-a-service-credential-user-who-has-a-connected-github-account).

1. Click on your app on your `Dashboard`.
2. Click `Settings` in the top navigation bar.
3. Find the `ENABLE SELECTIVE BUILDS` option and toggle the switch on the right.

4. Add filenames and file paths in the `ADD FILENAME/PATH` window. You can add multiple files or file paths here. A build will be triggered only if these files are changed.
