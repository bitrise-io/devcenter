## Exposed by the Bitrise CLI

These Environment Variables are available everywhere, even if you run the build on your own Mac
(using the [Bitrise CLI](https://www.bitrise.io/cli)):

* `BITRISE_TRIGGERED_WORKFLOW_ID` : the Workflow's ID which was triggered, either with `bitrise run` or `bitrise trigger`
* `BITRISE_TRIGGERED_WORKFLOW_TITLE` : the Workflow's title (if you provided one) which was triggered,
  either with `bitrise run` or `bitrise trigger`
* `BITRISE_BUILD_STATUS` : current status of the build - `"0"` if there are no failed steps yet,
  `"1"` if there's at least one failed step
* `BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR` : path of source / base workdir. By default it's the directory where `bitrise` runs
  (e.g. your repository root), unless you provide a different value.
  Can be overwritten during the build, which will change the working directory for subsequent Steps in the build.
* `BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR` : directory to store artifacts / files for deploy.
  It's a temporary directory created by `bitrise` CLI by default, and can be overwritten before starting `bitrise` CLI.
  _The content of this directory can be attached to the_ [_bitrise.io_](https://www.bitrise.io) _build page, as artifacts,_
  _with the_ _`Deploy to Bitrise.io`_ _step for example._
* `CI` : indicates whether `bitrise` CLI is running in CI (Continuous Integration) mode. Value can be `"true"` or `"false"`.
* `PR` : indicates whether `bitrise` CLI is running in PR (Pull Request) mode. Value can be `"true"` or `"false"`.
