## Developing iOS frameworks

When you are developing an iOS framework you have to distribute a code signed version of your framework, however you don't need to sign it with your `Distribution` profile, the `Developer` profile will be enough.
After distribution the framework will be re-codesigned by the frameworks' consumer during the code signing process.

If you attempt to build it without code signing Xcode won't produce a `.framework` file and you will receive the following error:

    CodeSign error: code signing is required for product type 'Framework' in SDK 'iOS 10.2'
