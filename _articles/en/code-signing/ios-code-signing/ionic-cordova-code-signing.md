Naturally, Bitrise supports iOS applications built with either **Ionic** or **Cordova**. However, the code signing process is slightly different compared to a native Xcode project.

Bitrise supports both manual and automatic provisioning for Ionic and Cordova apps as well - and once again, the processes are somewhat different.

## Ionic/Cordova code signing with manual provisioning

1. Generate the native Xcode project locally from your Ionic or Cordova project by calling `cordova platform add ios` or `ionic cordova platform add ios`.
2. Use our `codesigndoc` tool to [collect the code signing files](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/code-signing/ios-code-signing/collecting-files-with-codesigndoc/).
3. Upload the files to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

   You can do this either on the website UI or with the `codesigndoc` tool itself.

4. Make sure you have the **Certificate and profile installer** Step in your Workflow.
5. Add the **Generate cordova build configuration** Step to your Workflow. 
   It must come after the **Certificate and profile installer** Step.
6. Fill in the required inputs for the Step. 
   Please note that both the **Code Signing Identity** and the **Provisioning Profile** are required inputs for iOS apps even though they are not marked as such. 
   * **Build configuration**: you can set it to either `debug` or `release`.
   * **Code Sign Identity**: enter a Developer or a Distribution identity.
   * **Provisioning Profile**: enter the appropriate provisioning profile.
   * **Packaging Type**: this controls what type of build is generated by Xcode. Set the type of code signing you need.

7. Add the `Cordova archive` or the `Ionic archive` step to your workflow.
8. Fill in the required inputs.
   * The **Platform** input needs to be set to: `device`.
   * The **Build command configuration** input must match the **Build configuration** input of the **Generate cordova build configuration** Step.

   This Step must come after the **Generate cordova build configuration** Step in the Workflow.
9. Run your build!

## Ionic/Cordova code signing with auto provisioning

1. Make sure your .p12 signing certificates are uploaded to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

   If you use `codesigndoc` to collect the files, note that you can tell the tool to export only the certificates, by calling:

   ``` bash
   codesigndoc scan --certs-only xcode
   ```

   `codesigndoc` can also upload the files to the website, or you can do that manually.
2. Add the **Cordova prepare** or the **Ionic prepare** Step to your Workflow. These Steps call the `platform rm` and `platform add` commands.
3. Add the **iOS Auto Provision** Step to your Workflow. Please make sure it's the latest version!

   The step will export:
   * The project's development team.
   * The installed codesign identity's name.
   * The installed provisioning profile.

   These will be used by the **Generate cordova build configuration** Step.

   **IMPORTANT**: If you have both the **Certificate and profile installer** and the **iOS Auto Provisioning** Steps in your Workflow, your build might encounter unexpected issues.
4. Add the **Generate cordova build configuration** Step to your Workflow. 
5. Configure the Step to use the code signing settings exported by the **iOS Auto Prevision** Step:

   **Development distribution example**:

   ```yaml
   - generate-cordova-build-configuration:
   	inputs:
       - development_team: $BITRISE_DEVELOPER_TEAM 
       - package_type: development 
       - code_sign_identity: iPhone Developer
       - configuration: debug
   ```

   **Production distribution example**:

   ```yaml 
   - generate-cordova-build-configuration:
       inputs:
       - development_team: $BITRISE_DEVELOPER_TEAM 
       - package_type: app-store 
       - code_sign_identity: iPhone Developer
       - configuration: release
   ```
5. Add the **Cordova Archive** or the **Ionic Archive** Step to your Workflow.
6. Fill in the required inputs.
   * The **Platform** input needs to be set to: `device`.
   * The **Build command configuration** input must match the **Build configuration** input of the **Generate cordova build configuration** Step.

7. Set the **Should remove platforms as prepare step?** to `false`. 
   This is crucial: it ensures the Step will not remove and re-add the platform of the native projects generated in the **Cordova prepare** or the **Ionic prepare** Step.
8. Run your build!
