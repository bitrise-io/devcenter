The Stack indicates the virtual machine version that we will use to run your build. After adding your application to Bitrise we will select an appropriate Stack for it. Change it in the **Stacks** tab of the Workflow Editor.

After selecting the Stack you want to use, you'll see a short description of the stack with an additional link to learn more about that specific one (e.g. to see what tools are preinstalled, and which versions, on the selected Stack).

## Stack status types

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Stable | Generally available and expected to be supported for the foreseeable future. Updated when an update for the Stack's primary tool is available. Example: when Xcode 7.3.1 was released, the Xcode 7.3 stack was updated to have 7.3.1 instead of 7.3(.0). In case of Xamarin stacks, the Xamarin updates are applied weekly, during the weekends. |
| LTS (Long Term Support) | No changes (updates) will be made to the stack, except for absolutely crucial changes (for example which affect security), and Bitrise CLI tool updates. Preinstalled tool versions will remain the same, until the Stack is removed from our collection. |

## Stack prepare types

| Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Pre-Booted | If a Stack is available as pre-booted, and there's enough pre-booted machines with that Stack configuration, your build can start right away, without waiting for the build environment to boot. In case there's no more available pre-booted machine with that Stack configuration, your build will start on an On-Demand configuration. |
| On-Demand | If a Stack is available as on-demand configuration and there's no (available) pre-booted configuration for the Stack, our system will have to create a virtual machine for your selected configuration when your build starts. This means that your build will be in preparing environment state while the related Virtual Machine is created & booted. For a macOS configuration the boot process usually takes about 1 - 1.5 minutes. The prepare time (of course) is not counted into the build time, it won't affect how long your build can run. |

## What's preinstalled

Every time we create or update a Stack we publish a "System Report" for it as well. The System Reports include the list of preinstalled tools and their version on the stack. The System Report scripts are also open source, so if you want to run it yourself or you want to add another tool / system check, feel free to send us a pull request!

You can find every available stack's System Report on [GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/tree/master/system_reports).

## Choosing the right stack

When adding a new app on Bitrise, our project scanner will scan your app, and based on the platform type, it will select a default stack for it. 

However, you can change the stack any time if you wish. 

### Cross-platform apps

Our Xcode stacks are not exclusively for iOS apps: all Xcode stacks include Android tools, too - so you can use our Xcode stack for your cross-platform apps. 

Why should you choose this over the **Visual Studio for Mac** stack? That stack, formerly called the Hybrid stack, includes Xcode - but its version of Xcode is automatically upgraded from time to time. If, however, your cross-platform app requires a specific Xcode version then you should choose that particular Xcode stack. That way an Xcode upgrade will not break anything in your builds.

### Native iOS apps 

For the native iOS apps, it's simple: choose the stack that has the same Xcode version that you use to develop and build your app. 

### Native Android apps

For native Android apps, the recommended stack is still the [Android & Docker stack](/infrastructure/the-environment/) - it will surely serve all your needs. 

However, it is possible to use the Xcode stacks, as they also have Android tools installed.
