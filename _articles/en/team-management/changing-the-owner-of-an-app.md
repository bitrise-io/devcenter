It can happen that you need to transfer an application on [Bitrise](https://www.bitrise.io) to another user. This can be done in a few seconds by following these quick steps:

1. Login with the **current owner** of the app.
2. Open the app's page and go to the **Team** tab.
3. Make sure the new owner of the app is in the team or add her/him if you need to.
4. Click the `Transfer ownership` button on the right.

You can use the `Do you want to remain the connected services User?` toggle to stay the connected service user. This is important if you are the admin of the given repository on `GitHub`, or `Bitbucket` and the app needs your credentials to work on Bitrise.
