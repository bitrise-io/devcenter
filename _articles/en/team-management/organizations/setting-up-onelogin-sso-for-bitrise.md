This guide provides step-by-step instructions on setting up Bitrise as a SAML application on [OneLogin](https://www.onelogin.com/).

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="SAML SSO with Velocity plan" content="Please note that SAML SSO is only available for an Org with the [Org Elite and Velocity plans](https://www.bitrise.io/pricing). If you try to set up SAML SSO to an Org that has an [Org Standard subscription](https://www.bitrise.io/pricing/teams), the **Single Sign-On** tab will appear on the left menu bar in your **Account Settings** but you won’t be able to use it. Click **Upgrade to Org Elite** in the pop-up window to use SAML SSO in your Org.

Since the SAML SSO feature is tied to the Org Elite and Velocity plans, if you decide to downgrade, you will lose this feature. All Org members will receive an email about the downgrade and you’ll have two weeks to re-upgrade to the Org Elite plan if you wish to use SAML SSO in your Org again.

"%}

## Before you start

Before connecting SAML SSO to your Organization, make sure:

* The administrator to OneLogin is at hand while setting up SAML SSO connection on Bitrise.
* As with other [Org management actions](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/team-management/organizations/members-organizations/), only the Org owner can set up SAML SSO to a Bitrise Org.
* Your account on Bitrise has an Org with [Org Elite or Velocity plan](https://www.bitrise.io/pricing). If it doesn’t have an Org, go ahead and [create one](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/team-management/organizations/creating-org/). Setting up SAML SSO is the same for existing and brand new Orgs on Bitrise.

## Navigating to Single Sign On page of Bitrise

If you are a Workspace owner on Bitrise, you will have to use the **Single Sign-On** tab to set up a SAML SSO connection between your SAML SSO provider and your Bitrise Workspace.

1. On your Bitrise [Dashboard](https://app.bitrise.io/dashboard/builds) click your avatar, then click [**Account settings**](https://app.bitrise.io/me/profile#/overview) in the dropdown.[![](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/img/account-settings-dropdown.jpg)](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/img/account-settings-dropdown.jpg)
2. The **Overview** page displays all the Workspaces you’re a member of. Select the Workspace where you wish to set up the SAML SSO connection.[![](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/img/overview-tab.jpg)](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/img/overview-tab.jpg)
3. On the left menu bar, click the **Single Sign-On** which will take you to the **Enable Single Sign-On** page.[![](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/img/enablesinglesignon.jpg)](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/img/enablesinglesignon.jpg)
4. Continue with [Configuring Bitrise on OneLogin](/team-management/organizations/setting-up-onelogin-sso-for-bitrise/#configuring-bitrise-on-onelogin).

## Configuring Bitrise on OneLogin

 5. Click the **Configuration** tab on the left sidebar. You can change the icon and add descriptions if you wish. Make sure **Organization (Bitrise)** is ticked. Hit **Save**.

    ![{{ page.title }}](/img/add-bitrise-onelogin.jpg)
 6. Click the **Configuration** tab again and paste the **Assertion Consumer Service URL (ACS URL)** from your Bitrise Workspace’s **Single Sign-On** tab to the **Single Sign-On URL** field on OneLogin. Hit **Save** in **OneLogin**.

    ![{{ page.title }}](/img/application-details.jpg)
 7. Select **SSO** on the left sidebar.
 8. Click the **View details** for the X.509 Certificate. Copy the content of the **X.509 Certificate** and paste it to the **SAML SSO provider certificate** field on the **Enable Single Sign-On** page of Bitrise.
 9. Go back to the **SSO** page on OneLogin and copy the **SAML 2.0 Endpoint (HTTP)** link. Paste it in the **SAML SSO provider Single Sign-On URL (SSO URL)** field on Bitrise.
10. Go back to Bitrise and click **Configure SSO**.![](/img/enablesinglesignon.jpg)

{% include message_box.html type="note" title="Users on OneLogin and Bitrise" content="Make sure the users in your Bitrise Workspace are all added to the **Users** page on OneLogin. If not, go to **Users**, then **New User** and add the new user. Don’t forget to send out an invite (**More actions** drop-down menu, **Send Invitation**) to a new user so that the user can activate their account on OneLogin. Users must be added to the newly created Bitrise app by clicking **Applications** under **User Info** and clicking the **+** sign. Make sure the added users are all Workspace members on Bitrise.

![](/img/application-onelogin.jpg)"%}

If you’ve completed setting up Bitrise on OneLogin and connected it with your Bitrise Workspace, then all Organization members will get an email from Bitrise which contains a link to activate their SSO connection to the Bitrise Workspace.

## Enabling SAML SSO on Bitrise

All Workspace members (including the Workspace owner) must enable their SAML SSO connection to their Bitrise Workspace to use SAML SSO as a secure login method. Only once that’s done, can the Workspace owner enforce SAML SSO as the single gateway to the Workspace.

1. Find the email from [letsconnect@bitrise.io](mailto:letsconnect@bitrise.io "mailto:letsconnect@bitrise.io") in your inbox.![](/img/samlinviteemail.png)
2. Click **Sign in via SSO** or open the URL in a new tab of the same browser where you are logged in.
3. On the **Almost there** page you can edit your username. Click **Finish Sign Up**.![](/img/almostherepage.png)

You should be landing on the **Welcome** page of Bitrise. Click **Dashboard** to land on your Workspace's dashboard. If you go to your Workspace's **Groups** tab, you can see that you are automatically added as a SAML user. All Workspace members, who enable SAML SSO, appear here automatically. From now on you can log into your Bitrise Workspace with SAML SSO.

{% include message_box.html type="note" title="Signing up to Bitrise with SAML SSO" content=" If you’d like to learn more about SAML SSO on Bitrise, in particular, how to sign up to Bitrise with an Workspace's SAML SSO, check out our [SAML SSO in organizations guide](/team-management/organizations/saml-sso-in-organizations/). "%}

## What's next?

You can [track](/team-management/organizations/saml-sso-in-organizations/#checking-saml-sso-statuses-on-bitrise) how other Workspace members are getting on with enabling their SAML SSO to Bitrise. This is important since the Workspace owner can only [enforce](/team-management/organizations/saml-sso-in-organizations/#enforcing-saml-sso-on-an-organization) SAML SSO on the Workspace if all Workspace members have enabled SAML.
