This guide provides step-by-step instructions on setting up Bitrise as a SAML application on [Idaptive](https://www.idaptive.com/ "https://www.idaptive.com/").

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="SAML SSO with Velocity and Enterprise Build plan" content="Please note that SAML SSO is only available for a Workspace with the [Enterprise Build and Velocity plans](https://www.bitrise.io/pricing).

Since the SAML SSO feature is tied to the above plans, if you decide to downgrade, you will lose this feature. All Workspace members will receive an email about the downgrade and you’ll have two weeks to re-upgrade if you wish to use SAML SSO in your Workspace again.

"%}

## Before you start

* As with other [Workspace management actions](/team-management/organizations/members-organizations/), only the Workspace owner can set up SAML SSO to a Workspace on Bitrise.
* You must be logged into your Admin Portal on [Idaptive](https://www.idaptive.com/) to set up Bitrise as a SAML SSO app and establish the connection between Bitrise and Idaptive. If you are using the **User Portal**, **Switch to** **Admin Portal** by clicking your avatar on Idaptive.

* Your account on Bitrise has a Workspace with the [Velocity plan](https://www.bitrise.io/pricing). If it doesn’t have an Org, go ahead and [create one](/team-management/organizations/creating-org/). Setting up SAML SSO is the same for existing and brand new Orgs on Bitrise.

## Navigating to the Single Sign-On page of Bitrise

If you are a Workspace owner on Bitrise, you will have to use the **Single Sign-On** tab to set up a SAML SSO connection between your SAML SSO provider and your Bitrise Org.

1. On your Bitrise [Dashboard](https://app.bitrise.io/dashboard/builds) click your avatar, then click [**Profile settings**](https://app.bitrise.io/me/profile#/overview) in the dropdown. ![Account selector dropdown](/img/account-settings-dropdown.png)
2. The **Overview** page displays all the Orgs you’re a member of. Select the Workspace where you wish to set up the SAML SSO connection.![](/img/overview-tab.jpg)
3. On the left menu bar, click the **Single Sign-On** which will take you to the **Enable Single Sign-On** page.![](/img/enablesinglesignon.jpg)
4. Continue with [Getting configuration information from Idaptive](/team-management/organizations/setting-up-idaptive-saml-sso-for-bitrise/#getting-configuration-information-from-idaptive).

## Getting configuration information from Idaptive

 7. Insert the content or upload the file itself in the **SAML SSO provider certificate** text box on the **Enable Single Sign-On** page of Bitrise.
 8. Copy the **Single Sign On URL** from the **Trust** page of Idaptive. Insert it on the **SAML SSO provider Single Sing-On URL (SSO URL)** field on the **Enable Single Sign-On** page of Bitrise.
 9. While on the **Single Sign-On page** of Bitrise, copy the **Assertion Consumer Service URL (ACS URL)** URL and click **Configure SSO**.
10. Now let’s head back to Idaptive! Under **Service Provider Configuration** click **Manual Configuration**. Type **Bitrise** in the **SP Entity ID / Issuer / Audience** and paste the **Assertion Consumer Service URL (ACS URL)** from Bitrise to the **Assertion Consumer Service (ACS) URL** on Idaptive.

12. Go to **Permissions** and click the **Add** button. In the **Select User, Group, or Role** popup, type the user name you want to add to the SAML app. Select it and hit **Add**. Save your changes. This will change the status of your Bitrise SAML app to **Deployed**.

13. Continue with [Authorizing SAML SSO](/team-management/organizations/setting-up-idaptive-saml-sso-for-bitrise/#authorizing-saml-sso).

## Authorizing SAML SSO

Now that the Workspace owner has set up SAML SSO, everyone in the Workspacehas to authorize SAML SSO before logging in to their Workspace via SAML SSO.

1. Make sure you’re logged into Bitrise in the usual way. Use the same browser window to continue.
2. Bitrise sends a verification e-mail to all Workspace members. By clicking the **Log In via SAML SSO** button or using the provided URL, Workspace members can authorize themselves for SAML SSO login. The email also shows the Workspace owner’s email address (in case you would need to contact them.) Click the **Log In via SAML SSO** button or copy-paste the URL to a NEW TAB of the same browser.![](/img/email-samlssso.jpg)
3. You’re directed to Bitrise to **Allow “Workspace name” to sign you in** page.
   * Click **Authorize** if you trust the Workspace to control your Bitrise account sign-in process.  
     If you’re already logged in Idaptive, you’ll be automatically taken to your Bitrise Dashboard.  
     If you’re not, you’ll be prompted to log into Idaptive, and then taken to your Bitrise Dashboard.
   * Click **Don’t Allow** if the invitation email is from an untrusted source.

     Note that if you are using a different non-matching email address, you will get the below error message. Make sure you log in with the right email address both on Bitrise, as well as on your SSO provider site.![](/img/noconnectedsamlsso.png)

If all went well, you should be landing on our Bitrise Dashboard.
