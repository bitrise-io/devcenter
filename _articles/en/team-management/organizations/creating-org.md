A Workspace is an environment that allows you to manage your Bitrise apps and the team members working on the apps. You can create multiple Workspaces, and you can be invited to Workspaces by other Bitrise users. 

You must have access to at least one Workspace to be able to use Bitrise. When you create a new account, you canâ€™t add new apps or run builds. To be able to do so, you need to either create a Workspace, or to be invited to an existing one.

## Creating a Workspace

If you sign up for Bitrise, you are automatically prompted to create a new Workspace. If you skip creating a Workspace, or you want to create additional Workspaces later, you can of course do it:

1. Log in to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).
2. On the top menu bar, click the **+** symbol. 
3. Select **Create a Workspace**. This takes you to the **Create a new Workspace** page.

3. Find the **Workspace name** input field, and add a name.

4. Click **Create Workspace**. 
5. Choose a plan.  
   You have two options: Teams and Hobby. If you're interested in the details, or you want to find out more about our other plans, check out our [Pricing page](https://www.bitrise.io/pricing/) for more info.
6. Click either **Subscribe to Teams** or **Subscribe to Hobby**.

And that's it! You can start adding apps and inviting people to your Workspace!
