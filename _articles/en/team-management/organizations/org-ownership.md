Organization owners can access and delete all apps linked to the Organization, can manage the billing details of an Organization and can add or remove other owners. Organization owners are in their own group in the Organization and they are managed via membership in this group.

Every Organization must have at least one owner.

## Adding owners to an Organization

1. Sign in with an account that is an owner of an Organization and open its profile page.
2. Go to your Organization's profile page: click **Switch Profile** on the top left corner and select the Organization you need.
