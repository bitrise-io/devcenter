It's very simple to set up a subscription plan for your Organization even if you skipped that step when creating the Organization. You can also modify your plan and your billing information at any time if you are the owner of the Organization.

You can set up a credit card and we'll bill you automatically; for other payment methods, please contact our support.

Please note that Organizations is a PREMIUM FEATURE. You need to subscribe to an **Organization** plan to be able to run builds.

### Adding or modifying billing info

1. Sign in with an account that is an owner of an Organization and open its profile page.
2. Go to your Organization's profile page: click **Switch Profile** on the top left corner and select the Organization you need.

   Be aware that your own billing info and your Organization's billing info are SEPARATE. You CANNOT change your Organization's billing info and subscription plans in the settings of your own personal profile!
3. On the left, select **Billing** from the menu options.

   If you do not want to be billed automatically, you do not need to provide a credit card. In this case, contact our support to set up a different payment method, such as wire transfer. This option is available from 6x concurrency on Standard plans or 3x concurrency on Elite plans but only with ANNUAL BILLING.
5. Fill out the details.

   Note that only the owner(s) of the Organization's has any access to the Organization's billing information.
