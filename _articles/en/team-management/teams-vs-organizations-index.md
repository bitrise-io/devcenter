There are two types of accounts on Bitrise:

* individual user accounts
* organization accounts

When signing up to Bitrise, you create an individual user account. Individual users can create their own applications or be invited to work on other applications.

### Teams vs organizations

The most important concepts to managing apps on Bitrise are:

* Teams: They are based on the applications: all users invited to work on a given app which makes up the team of the application. [Owners and admins can assign roles](/team-management/user-roles-on-app-teams/) on the teams.


* Organizations: [They are created by individual users](/team-management/organizations/creating-org/). Organizations can have an unlimited number of members and can own and control an unlimited amount of apps. Organizations need their own payment plan: even if the organization's creator is already subscribed to Bitrise, a separate payment plan must be set up for the organization itself.

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Teams vs groups" content="Teams and groups are not the same! [Groups are the main building blocks of organizations](/team-management/organizations/members-organizations/) but by themselves have no powers: they need to be [assigned to apps](/team-management/organizations/managing-apps/#assigning-groups-to-apps).

Organization members can be assigned to applications individually or as a group. The same organization group can have different roles on different application teams. "%}

So here's a quick summary of teams and organizations:

| Teams | Organizations |
| --- | --- |
| App-based | Global |
| Roles assigned by the app's admins or owners | No inherent roles: just owners and members |
| Only have access to a single app | Can own and control multiple apps |
