When you sign up for Bitrise, you create your own individual user account. By itself, having a user account isn't enough to add apps and run builds. To be able to work on Bitrise, you need at least one of three options:

- [Create your own Workspace](/team-management/organizations/creating-org/).
- [Get invited to an existing Workspace](/team-management/organizations/members-organizations/).
- [Get added as an outside contributor to an app's team](/team-management/organizations/managing-apps/#adding-contributors-to-an-app).

To sign up for a paid subscription of your own, you need to [create your own Workspace](/team-management/organizations/creating-org).

In [Teams vs Workspaces](/team-management/teams-vs-organizations-index/#teams-vs-workspaces), we discuss the difference between Workspaces and app teams. 

## Teams vs Workspaces

The most important concepts to managing apps on Bitrise are:

* Teams: They are based on the applications: all users invited to work on a given app which makes up the team of the application. [Owners and admins can assign roles](/team-management/user-roles-on-app-teams/) on the teams.

* Workspaces: [They are created by individual users](/team-management/organizations/creating-org/). Workspaces can have an unlimited number of members and can own and control an unlimited amount of apps. Workspaces need their own payment plan: even if the Workspace's creator is already subscribed to Bitrise, a separate payment plan must be set up for the Workspace itself.

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Teams vs groups" content="Teams and groups are not the same! [Groups are the main building blocks of Workspaces](/team-management/organizations/members-organizations/) but by themselves have no powers: they need to be [assigned to apps](/team-management/organizations/managing-apps/#assigning-groups-to-apps).

Workspace members can be assigned to applications individually or as a group. The same Workspace group can have different roles on different application teams. "%}

So here's a quick summary of teams and Workspaces:

| Teams | Workspaces |
| --- | --- |
| App-based | Global |
| Roles assigned by the app's admins or owners | No inherent roles: just owners and members |
| Only have access to a single app | Can own and control multiple apps |
