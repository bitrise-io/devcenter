On Bitrise, there are two subscription types for personal accounts: the Hobby plan and the Developer plan. The Hobby plan is our free plan while the Developer plan is the only premium plan that you can use without creating an Organization.

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Personal accounts and Org accounts" content="Be aware that personal accounts and Organization accounts are separate! This means that in order to sign up for an Organization plan, you need to create an Organization and then provide valid payment information in the Org's **Billing** section,  Read more about Organizations in the [Organizations section](/team-management/organizations/organizations-index/)." %}

You can switch between the two - upgrade to Developer or downgrade to Hobby - at any time.

## Adding and updating payment information

To sign up for a Developer plan, you will need to provide a valid credit card. You can update your credit card number at any time after setting it.

1. Log in to your Bitrise account.
2. Click BitBot in the top right corner and select **Account settings** from the dropdown menu.
3. Scroll down, and from the left side menu, select **Billing**.
4. Scroll down to the **Billing information** section.  
   \- If you’re adding a payment option for the first time, click **Add credit card**.  
   \- If want to modify your existing payment information, click **Edit billing**.
5. Add valid credit card information and a billing address.
6. Click **Save**.

## Signing up for a Developer subscription plan

As a Hobby user, you can upgrade to the Developer plan at any time.

You can only sign up for the Developer plan if you provided valid payment information.

1. Log in to your Bitrise account.
2. Click BitBot in the top right corner and select **Account settings** from the dropdown menu.
3. Scroll down, and from the left side menu, select **Billing**.
4. In the **Plans** section, select **DEVELOPER**.
5. In the **Redeem coupon** box, enter any coupon code you have.  
   If you do not have a coupon, leave it empty.
6. Choose between monthly and annual billing.
7. Click **Change plan**.

And that’s it - if you provided valid payment information, we’ll charge you immediately, and you can start using Bitrise with the Developer subscription plan.

## Canceling your Developer subscription plan

If you decide you no longer wish to pay for the Developer plan, you can cancel it any time by simply downgrading to a Hobby plan. You can keep using the Developer plan until your last paid month is over (for example, if you decide to cancel your plan 10 days after your last billing date, you can still use the plan for another 20 days).

1. Log in to your Bitrise account.
2. Click BitBot in the top right corner and select **Account settings** from the dropdown menu.
3. Scroll down, and from the left side menu, select **Billing**.
4. In the **Plans** section, select **HOBBY**.
5. Click **Change plan**.

That’s it!
