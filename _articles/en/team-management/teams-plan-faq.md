## When will my trial end?

As of now, Teams plan trials are indefinite, there’s no determined timeframe. You can use the Teams plan trial as long as you have credits.

## When can I sign up for the full Teams plan?

The full, paid version of the Teams plan is still a work in progress. You can [register your interest](https://survey.alchemer.eu/s3/90327895/Teams-plan-demand-survey), and we’ll let you know once we have more news.

## What features will the Teams plan have?

The benefits of the Teams plan include:

* Unlimited private apps.
* Unlimited team members and all the team management features.
* Multiple machines types to choose from.
* Add-ons, such as Test Reports and Ship.

## How do I get credits?

You get 500 credits for the trial. If you run out, we’ll contact you to get your feedback. You can have a short call with our researcher for 300 credits, or answer a few questions in a survey for 100 credits. If you run out of credits again after giving feedback, please contact our [Customer Success team](https://support.bitrise.io/requests/new), and we’ll be more than happy to help you out.

## How do I use my credits?
