You can enable or disable a Step in any given workflow, and you can also set conditions for Steps. You can do it either on your own computer, with the Bitrise CLI or by using the **bitrise.yml** tab of the Workflow Editor.

We mostly use `run_if` expressions to do these things. [Check out the template expressions](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/blob/master/_examples/experimentals/templates/bitrise.yml)!

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="A `run_if` can be any valid Go template" content=" A `run_if` can be any valid [Go template](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/), as long as it evaluates to `true` or `false` (or any of the String representation, for example `True`, `t`, `yes` or `y` are all considered to be `true`). If the template evaluates to `true`, the Step will run, otherwise it won't. "%}

An example `run_if` to check a custom Environment Variable:

    {% raw %}
    run_if: |-
     	{{enveq "CUSTOM_ENV_VAR_KEY" "test value to test against"}}
    {% endraw %}    

This `run_if` will skip the Step if the value of `CUSTOM_ENV_VAR_KEY` is not `test value to test against`.

## Disabling a Step

If you do not want to remove a Step from your Workflow but you don't want it to run, you can disable it, using a `run_if` expression.

1. Open your app's `bitrise.yml` file.
2. Find the Step that you want to disable.
3. Add `run_if: false` to it.

Example:

    - script:
        run_if: false
        inputs:
        - content: |-
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "This will never run, because of run_if:false"

{% include message_box.html type="note" title="Experimenting with Workflows" content="To experiment with different configurations for a workflow, without removing or disabling Steps, we recommend cloning the Workflow. You can modify the cloned Workflow as much as you wish without changing anything in the original."%}

## Running a Step only in a CI environment

Running a Step only in a CI environment means your build will skip that particular Step for local builds. Like disabling Steps, you can do this with a `run_if` expression. Use this to debug builds locally.

1. Open your app's `bitrise.yml` file.
2. Find the Step that you want to disable.
3. Add `run_if: .IsCI` to it.

Example:

    - script:
        run_if: .IsCI
        inputs:
        - content: |-
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "This will only ever run in a CI environment because run_if: IsCI"

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="The `.IsCI` flag" content="Many Steps have this .`IsCI` flag set by default: for example, the `Git Clone` Step. However, you can change the `run_if` property of these Steps, too: just set it to `run_if: true`."%}

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="Enable CI mode" content=" CI mode can be enabled on your own Mac/PC by setting the `CI` environment to `true` (for example, run `export CI=true` in your Bash Terminal), or by running `bitrise run` with the `--ci` flag: `bitrise --ci run ...`. "%}

## Running a Step only if the build failed

It is possible to run a Step ONLY if the build failed before it got to that particular Step. In addition to `run_if`, you will need to use the `is_always_run` property as well.

1. Open your app's `bitrise.yml` file.
2. Find the Step that you want to disable.
3. Add `run_if: .IsBuildFailed` to it.
4. Add `is_always_run: true` to it.

   This enables the Step to run even if a previous Step failed.

Example:

    - script:
        is_always_run: true
        run_if: .IsBuildFailed
        inputs:
        - content: |-
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "Build Failed!"
