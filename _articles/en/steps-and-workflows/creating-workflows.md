It's very simple to create your own workflow with the Workflow Editor. You can create new workflows based on any of the existing ones, or you can simply create an empty workflow and add the steps yourself.

If, for example, you create a workflow based on your `primary` one, it means that it will be created with the exact same Steps as the `primary` workflow.

1. Click the app's `Workflow` tab. Note that you cannot leave the Workflow editor without either saving or discarding any changes you made.
2. Click `+ Workflow`

3. Select the workflow you want to use as the basis for the new one. Alternatively, choose the `Empty workflow` option to create an empty workflow

4. Add the Steps you need to your workflow. Click the `+` symbol between two Steps to insert a Step at that position. Remove Steps you do not need by clicking on the Step and clicking the little trash bin symbol.
5. Click `Save` in the top right corner.
