## Response

Every endpoint responds with a JSON formatted response.

### Pagination

When you call an endpoint that returns a list of items, you might not get the whole list in a single response. You'll have to iterate through the "pages" to retrieve all the items.

The response of such endpoints include a `paging` object, with `total_item_count` and `page_item_limit` properties. If there is a "next" page available, it'll also include a `next` "anchor" item. For example, the response will show the app slug of the first app on the next page.

**Example**

    {
      "data": [ ... ],
      "paging": {
        "total_item_count": 3,
        "page_item_limit": 2,
        "next": "518e869d56f2adfd"
      }
    }

{% include message_box.html type="note" title="The `next` property of the `paging` object" content=" The `next` property of the `paging` object is only included if there's at least one more page available. If there's no `next` property inside `paging` that means that there's no more page to retrieve. "%}

#### Limiting response items

The `page_item_limit` property can be set with the query parameter named `limit` at the GET requests, so you can specify the size of the response pages. The default and also maximum value for this parameter is 50.

**Example**

* Calling `https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/me/apps` will retrieve you the first page of your apps with size of 50.
* If you call `https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/me/apps?limit=10`, the response is also the first page of your apps, but it will contain only 10 elements.

#### Iterating through response items

If you want to iterate through all the items, this is what you have to do:

1. Call the endpoint without any pagination parameters.
2. From the response process the `paging` object.
3. If the `paging` object includes a `next` item, call the exact same endpoint with an additional `next=` query parameter, and pass the value you got in the response as the value of the `next` parameter.

**Example**

Iterating through all your registered apps:

1. Call `https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/me/apps`.
2. Process the items (`data` property).
3. Check the `paging` (root) property.
4. If there's a `next` property inside `paging`, call the endpoint again, with the `next` query parameter
   * Example: `https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/me/apps?next=NEXTVALUE`, where `NEXTVALUE` is the value of the `next` property you got in your previous response.
5. Repeat this until the `paging` object does not include a `next` property, which means that the page you received was the last one.
