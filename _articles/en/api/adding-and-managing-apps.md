Set up new apps on Bitrise with the API: add the app, generate SSH keys, and set up the app's initial configuration.

In addition, you can list all apps belonging, for example, to a single user or to a specific organization.

## Adding a new app

| Endpoints | Function |
| --- | --- |
| [POST /apps/register](https://api-docs.bitrise.io/#/app-setup/app-create) | Add a new app. |
| [POST /apps/{app-slug}/register-ssh-key](https://api-docs.bitrise.io/#/app-setup/ssh-key-create) | Add an SSH-key to a specific app. |
| [POST /apps/{app-slug}/finish](https://api-docs.bitrise.io/#/app-setup/app-finish) | Save the application at the end of the application add process. |
| [POST /apps/{app-slug}/bitrise.yml](https://api-docs.bitrise.io/#/app-setup/app-config-create) | Upload a new bitrise.yml for your application. |

There are three distinct steps to adding an app with the Bitrise API.

1. Registering the app.
2. Setting up an SSH key.
3. Finishing the app registration.

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Apps with HTTPS git URLs" content="The procedure and the examples are aimed at adding a private app with an SSH git URL. If you want to add an app with an HTTPS git URL, you can skip adding an SSH key."%}

Before you start, generate [an SSH keypair](/faq/how-to-generate-ssh-keypair/):

    ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -P '' -f ./bitrise-ssh -m PEM  

You will need both the private and public key in full to register an SSH key for your Bitrise app.

1. Register the app by calling the `register` endpoint and setting all required parameters.

   You need to set your git provider, the repository URL, the slug of the repository as it appears at the provider, and the slug of the owner of the repository.

       curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: ACCESS-TOKEN' 'https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/apps/register' -d \
       '{
	         "provider": "github",
	         "is_public": false,
	         "repo_url": "git@github.com:api_demo/example-repository.git",
	         "type": "git",
	         "git_repo_slug": "example-repository",
	         "git_owner": "api_demo"
        }'

   If you want to add an app to an organization, you'll have to include the organization at the end of the curl request:

       curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: ACCESS-TOKEN' 'https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/apps/register' -d \
       '{
	        "provider": "github",
	        "is_public": false,
	        "repo_url": "git@github.com:api_demo/example-repository.git",
	        "type": "git",
	        "git_repo_slug": "example-repository",
	        "git_owner": "api_demo",
	        "organization_slug": ""
        }'
2. Once done, call the `register-ssh-key` endpoint to set up the SSH keys you created so that Bitrise can clone your repository when running a build.

   You need to provide both your private and public SSH key. Please note that if you wish to copy the private key manually, you need to escape all the linebreaks with `\n`.

   You can also set whether you want to automatically register the public key at your git provider: set the `is_register_key_into_provider_service` parameter to either true or false.

       curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: ACCESS-TOKEN' 'https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/apps/APP-SLUG/register-ssh-key' -d \
       '{
	       "auth_ssh_private_key": "your-private-ssh-key",
	       "auth_ssh_public_key": "your-public-ssh-key",
	       "is_register_key_into_provider_service": false
        }'
3. Finish the app registration process by calling the `finish` endpoint.

   This endpoint allows you to configure your applications: set the project type, the stack on which the build will run, and the initial configuration settings.

   You can also set environment variables, as well as immediately specify an organization that will be the owner of the application. Please note that the `mode` parameter must be set to the value of `manual`.

       curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: ACCESS-TOKEN' 'https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/apps/APP-SLUG/finish' -d \
       '{
	        "project_type": "ios",
	        "stack_id": "osx-vs4mac-stable",
	        "config": "default-ios-config",
	        "mode": "manual",
	        "envs": {
		          "env1": "val1",
		          "env2": "val2"
	        },
	        "organization_slug": "e1ec3dea540bcf21"
        }'

You're done! Your new app is ready.

### Uploading a new bitrise.yml file

The `bitrise.yml` file contains the configuration of your builds. You can modify the current one via the API by posting a full YAML configuration. The below example shows a basic `.yml` configuration.

    curl -X POST -H 'Authorization: ACCESS-TOKEN' 'https://api.bitrise.io/v0.1/apps/APP-SLUG/bitrise.yml' -d \
    '{"app_config_datastore_yaml":"
        app: 
          envs: 
          - BITRISE_PROJECT_PATH: build.gradle   
            opts:      
              is_expand: false
              default_step_lib_source: https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib.git
              format_version: 1.1.9"}'

By calling this endpoint, you replace the app's current `bitrise.yml` file. You can, of course, modify this uploaded `bitrise.yml` either via the API or on the website itself.

## Managing an existing app

| Endpoints | Function |
| --- | --- |
| [GET /apps](https://api-docs.bitrise.io/#/application/app-list) | Get list of your apps. |
| [GET /apps/{app-slug}](https://api-docs.bitrise.io/#/application/app-show) | Get a specific app. |
| [GET /apps/{app-slug}/bitrise.yml](https://api-docs.bitrise.io/#/application/app-config-datastore-show) | Get the bitrise.yml of a specific app. |
| [GET /apps/{app-slug}/branches](https://api-docs.bitrise.io/#/application/branch-list) | List the branches of an app's repository. |
| [GET /organizations/{org-slug}/apps](https://api-docs.bitrise.io/#/application/app-list-by-organization) | Get list of the apps for an organization. |
| [GET /users/{user-slug}/apps](https://api-docs.bitrise.io/#/application/app-list-by-user) | Get list of the apps for a user. |

The response to any GET request regarding one or more applications will contain the app slug, its project type, the git provider, the repository's owner and URL:

    {
      "data": [
        {
          "slug": "eeeeefffff00000",
          "title": "sample-app",
          "project_type": "android",
          "provider": "github",
          "repo_owner": "example-user",
          "repo_url": "git@github.com:example-user/sample-app.git",
          "repo_slug": "android-gradle-kotlin-dsl",
          "is_disabled": false,
          "status": -1,
          "is_public": false,
          "owner": {
            "account_type": "organization",
            "name": "Test Org",
            "slug": "fffffeeeee00000"
          },
          "avatar_url": null
        },
        {

You can also download the existing bitrise.yml file of any app: the response will contain the full YAML configuration.
