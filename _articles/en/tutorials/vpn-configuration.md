Do you require a VPN connection for your build, to be able to connect to your server, either to `git clone` your repository or to access a private API? If yes, then this tutorial is for you!

## Technical information

To connect to a VPN, you need to:

1. Install and configure the required VPN components
2. Connect to the VPN

You can configure and connect a VPN anywhere in your Workflow - BEFORE you would use the VPN connection, of course. For example, if you require a VPN connection to access your repository, you have to connect before the `Git Clone` Step.

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="SSH sessions" content="When you choose your VPN tool and do the setup/configuration, you have to be careful **not to restart or abort** existing SSH sessions! The [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) workers will abort the build if the SSH connection between the build's Control/Master machine and the build virtual machine terminates!"%}

## Example configurations

### Using the `Connect to OpenVPN Server` Step

To use the `Connect to OpenVPN Server` Step, you need to build an OpenVPN server in advance. [Read more about how to set up an OpenVPN server](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-an-openvpn-server-on-ubuntu-18-04).

Once the server is ready, encode the following in Base64:

* CA certificate
* client certificate
* client private key

You can base64 encode files with the following command:

    $ base64 <filepath>

Now you are ready to set up the VPN on Bitrise, in the Workflow Editor of your app:

1. Register the encoded certificates and the key as [Secrets](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/builds/env-vars-secret-env-vars/#adding-a-secret-env-var) on [bitrise.io]().

   We recommend using the following keys as they are the default inputs for the VPN Step:
   * CA certificate: `$VPN_CA_CRT_BASE64`
   * Client certificate: `$VPN_CLIENT_CRT_BASE64`
   * Private key: `VPN_CLIENT_KEY_BASE64`
2. Add the `Connect to OpenVPN Server` Step to your workflow.

   Don't forget to add the Step before any Steps that might require VPN connection.
3. [Add the previously created Secrets](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/getting-started-steps/#environment-variables-as-step-inputs) to their respective inputs:
   * `Base64 encoded CA Certificate`
   * `Base64 encoded Client Certificate`
   * `Base64 encoded Client Private Key`

   If you created the Secrets with the recommended keys, you do not have to change the inputs.
4. Fill in the other required inputs.
   * `Host`: the Open VPN Server IP or hostname
   * `Port`: OpenVPN Server Port number
   * `Protocol`: OpenVPN Server Protocol

### Strongswan VPN setup

This is an example script which you can either save into your repository and run it from there, or just copy paste its content into a `Script Step` in your `bitrise` configuration (`bitrise.yml` / Workflow).

### Cisco VPN connect

You can use the `Cisco VPN connect` Step: it connects with Cisco VPN provided by VPN3000 Concentrator, Juniper/Netscreen, IOS and PIX using **vpnc**.

To provide VPN client settings and credentials required for the Step, you can:

* use the existing vpnc configuration file: `vpnc.conf`
* use the `Command line options` input of the Step. The options specified in this input will take precedence over the configuration file!

For more information on setting up vpnc, check the [vpnc homepage](https://www.unix-ag.uni-kl.de/\~massar/vpnc/)Â and the [vpnc manual](https://linux.die.net/man/8/vpnc).
