To restore your [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) packages, simply go to the app on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io), and select the **Workflow** tab to open the Workflow Editor.

Add the **NuGet Restore** Step to your workflow, after the **Git Clone** Step. By default, the Step will use the same solution file that you have provided when you added your app, but you can simply modify it if you need to.
