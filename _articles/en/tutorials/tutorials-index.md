Welcome to the Tutorials section! Here we are offering more detailed, in-depth guides, often specific to certain platforms or tools.

We are always happy to receive user submissions to this section: the [Community Created Tutorials](/tutorials/community-created/) is a collection of in-depth Bitrise-related guides that are hosted on other websites.

You can also submit a guide to be included in full in our documentation: if you have a proposal, [contact us](https://www.bitrise.io/contact)!

Check out the specific sections within our tutorials:

* [Fastlane](/tutorials/fastlane/index/) - How to configure and use fastlane on Bitrise.
* [Xamarin](/tutorials/xamarin/index/) - We support Xamarin apps out of the box.
* [Docker](/tutorials/docker/index/) - You can use your own docker image!
