This tutorial describes how you can link Firebase App distribution to a Bitrise Workflow.



Before you start, make sure you are signed in to your Firebase account on your computer. 

1. Open a command line interface and install the [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli):

```bash 
curl -sL https://firebase.tools | bash
```
2. Once the installation is finished, log in to the Firebase CLI: 

```bash 
firebase login:ci
```
After a successfully running the `login` command for the first time, the CLI provides a token. This token can be used to log in to a CI server. 

3. no need to add Service Credentials File if you dont use it 

4. Add You App Path (Ipa or Apk) 
PS: sometimes you need to add full Archive path 

5. Add the testers group that you added in App distribution on your Firebase account: 

<div class="banner">

	<div class="deploy-text">Manage Middleman projects with Bitrise</div>
	<a target="_blank" href="https://app.bitrise.io/dashboard/builds"><button class="button">Go to your app</button></a>
</div>
