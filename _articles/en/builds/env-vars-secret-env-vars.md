Every secret Environment Variable (Env Var) is an Env Var but not every Env Var is a secret Env Var!

## About Env Vars

In your Workflow Editor, you can set an Env Var with a key and a value in the **Env Vars** tab which is a collection of all the Env Vars registered for your app. Env vars can be referenced as many times as you wish in any of your Workflow Steps, unless you set them for a specific Workflow.

Check out our short YouTube tutorial on [how to insert variables in Step inputs](https://youtu.be/atuP_1KN41Q)!

If you click the **insert variable** button next to any Step input field in your Workflow, you can select the suitable Env Var from the **Insert variable** pop-up window. This interactive list displays all the available Env Vars you have set in the **Env Vars** tab and those that have been already generated by previous Steps in the Workflow.

For example, if you click into an input of the third Step of your Workflow, the **Insert variable** list will include all the Env Vars (outputs) generated by the first and second steps, and the ones you have registered in **Env Vars**. The list will not show those which will be generated by the fourth, fifth, sixth Steps.

You can also replace the variable for a new one in **Env Vars**. Delete the old value and set the new one. If you toggle the **Replace variables in inputs** to the right, the new value will be used everywhere in your Workflow.

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Protect your secrets" content=" Contrary to [secret Env Vars](#about-secrets/), Env Vars are fully exposed in builds triggered by pull requests so you should not add any sensitive information to **Env Vars**. "%}

### Setting an Env Var in Workflows

Under **App Environmental Variables**, you can set all the Env Vars you wish to use later on in all your Workflows.

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="Custom Env Vars" content="When you [start a build manually](), you can set custom Environment Variables in the advanced options. However, be aware that if they have the same key as an App Env Var, the latter takes precedence! That is, if they have the same key but different values, the build will use the value of the App Env Var."%}

You can set Env Vars for any of your Workflows separately as well. If you wish to set an Env Var with a variable which will be only used in a particular Workflow, then select the respective Workflow from the list and add the Env Var there. The list is comprised of the Workflows you named for your app. (In this example below, the app has a **deploy**, **primary** and **dummy** Workflow.)

## About Secrets

Secret Env Vars are special type of Env Vars as they hide information in an encrypted format so that your private input is not exposed in the build logs/`bitrise.yml`. Secret Env Vars can be set by adding the Env Var key and the variable in the **Secrets** tab of the Workflow Editor.

### Adding a secret Env Var

You can add a secret Env Var to your Workflow using our **Secrets** tab.

1. Click **Add new** on the **Secrets** tab.
2. Set the **key** and **value** fields.

You can also add a secret Env Var directly in a [Step's](/builds/sensitive-input-field/#set-a-sensitive-input-in-a-step/) `SENSITIVE` input.

### Editing a secret Env Var

Once you've added a new secret Env Var in the **Secrets** tab, you come back to it any time, modify its content or make it protected from curious eyes!

1. Click **Edit** next to the value of  your secret Env Var.
2. Modify its content if needed.
3. If you want to hide the value, click **Make it protected**. A lock is shown.
4. **Delete** the secret Env Var if you do not need it any more. Please note if you hit this button, the whole row will get deleted.

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Life after **Make it protected** " content=" Please note if you clicked this button, neither you nor anybody with the access to the app can unlock or check the value again.

Since this change is irreversible, a confirmation pop-up window will be displayed prior to saving your changes.

You can **show** and **hide** the value of an Env Var with the **eye** icon. This feature is useful if you have a long list of secret env vars in **Secrets** and you wish to check the value of only one secret env var while leaving the other values hidden. If a value is hidden, it's represented with the **crossed out eye** icon.

![{{ page.title }}](/img/eye-icon.png)

If you toggle the **Replace variables in inputs** to the right, the new value will be used everywhere in your Workflow.

If builds triggered by Pull Requests need to access Secrets' values, then toggle the **Expose for Pull Request** to the right. This will make Secrets' values available for the build machines. In build logs, however, none of your Secrets' values will be available but printed as [REDACTED].

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="About SENSITIVE label" content=" In the case of [public apps](/adding-a-new-app/public-apps/), Step input fields containing sensitive information are marked with a **SENSITIVE** label and only secret Env Vars can be used there! The **Expose for Pull Request** toggle is by default disabled and cannot be enabled since your secrets must be kept hidden in publicly accessible build logs! "%}
