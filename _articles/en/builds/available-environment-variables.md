Environment Variables (Env Vars) consist of a key and a value, as well as optional attributes. They can be defined on the level of apps, Workflows or Steps.

## Exposed by the Bitrise CLI

These Environment Variables are available everywhere, even if you run the build on your own computer, using the [Bitrise CLI](https://www.bitrise.io/cli).

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_TRIGGERED_WORKFLOW_ID" content="`$BITRISE_TRIGGERED_WORKFLOW_ID`: The ID of the Workflow that was triggered. This env var is exposed regardless of whether the Workflow was triggered manually or automatically. "%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_TRIGGERED_WORKFLOW_TITLE" content="`$BITRISE_TRIGGERED_WORKFLOW_TITLE`: The title of the Workflow that was triggered - if it has a title, which is completely optional. This Env Var is exposed regardless of whether the Workflow was triggered manually or automatically." %}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_BUILD_STATUS" content="`$BITRISE_BUILD_STATUS`: The current status of the build. The available options are:

* 0: Successful.
* 1: Failed.

A successful current status means that none of the previous Steps in the build failed."%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR" content="`$BITRISE_SOURCE_DIR`: Path to the base working directory. By default, it's the directory where Bitrise runs
(for example, your repository root), unless you provide a different value. This can be overwritten during the build, which will change the working directory for subsequent Steps in the build. "%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR" content="`$BITRISE_DEPLOY_DIR`: Path to the directory that stores artifacts and files for deployment.
It's a temporary directory created by the Bitrise CLI by default, and can be overwritten before starting the Bitrise CLI. The **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step looks for your build artifacts - such as an IPA or APK of the app -, test results, and other files in this directory." %}

{% include collapse.html title="$CI" content="`$CI`: Indicates whether the Bitrise CLI is running in CI (Continuous Integration) mode. Value can be `true` or `false`. It is false if, for example, your run Bitrise on your own computer." %}

{% include collapse.html title="$PR" content="`$PR`: Indicates whether the Bitrise CLI is running in PR (Pull Request) mode. Value can be `true` or `false`. Running in Pull Request mode means that Bitrise builds your code in the state as if the Pull Request was already merged. " %}

## Exposed by Bitrise.io

These Environment Variables are available for builds running on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) virtual machines.

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_BUILD_NUMBER" content="`$BITRISE_BUILD_NUMBER`: Build number of the build on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io). You can [modify any app's build number](/builds/build-numbering-and-app-versioning/#changing-the-build-number-of-your-build) if you want to - for example, if you wish to reset to 1."%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_APP_TITLE" content="`$BITRISE_APP_TITLE`: The title of your app on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io). You can change it any time on the **Settings** tab of the app. "%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_APP_URL" content="`$BITRISE_APP_URL`: The URL or your app on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io). This is not the same as the git repository URL! An app URL has the following format:

`app.bitrise.io/APP-SLUG/`

For example: https://app.bitrise.io/app/31e481ce08e0xfd9. This is not a real app URL, of course: a genuine URL can't contain an x."%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_APP_SLUG" content="`$BITRISE_APP_SLUG`: The slug that uniquely identifies your app on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io). It's part of the app URL, too.

For example, let's take a look at this app URL: https://app.bitrise.io/app/31e481ce08e0xfd9. The app slug is `31e481ce08e0xfd9` in this example. This is not a real app URL and app slug, of course: a genuine slug can't contain an x."%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_BUILD_URL" content="`$BITRISE_BUILD_URL`: The URL of the build on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io). A build URL has the following format:

`app.bitrise.io/build/BUILD-SLUG`

For example: https://app.bitrise.io/build/d75abbebxfc9ca4e. This is not a real build URL, of course: a genuine URL can't contain an x in the build slug."%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_BUILD_SLUG" content="`$BITRISE_BUILD_SLUG`: The slug that uniquely identifies a build on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io). It's part of the build URL, too.

For example, let's take a look at this build URL: https://app.bitrise.io/build/d75abbebxfc9ca4e. The build slug is `d65abbebxfc9ca4e` in this example. This is not a real build URL and build slug, of course: a genuine URL can't contain an x."%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_BUILD_TRIGGER_TIMESTAMP" content="`$BITRISE_BUILD_TRIGGER_TIMESTAMP`: The date and time when the build was triggered."%}

{% include collapse.html title="$GIT_REPOSITORY_URL" content="`$GIT_REPOSITORY_URL`: The URL of the Git repository that hosts your app. This can be changed in the **Settings** tab of the app. It can be in either SSH or HTTPS format."%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_GIT_BRANCH" content="`$BITRISE_GIT_BRANCH`: The git branch that is built by Bitrise. For example, `master`. "%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISEIO_GIT_BRANCH_DEST" content="`$BITRISEIO_GIT_BRANCH_DEST`: Used only with builds triggered by pull requests: the destination/target branch of the pull request that triggered the build.

For example, a pull request wants to merge the content of a branch into the branch `master`. In this case, this Env Var's value is `master`. "%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_GIT_TAG" content="`$BITRISE_GIT_TAG`: You can [use Git Tags to trigger builds](/builds/triggering-builds/trigger-git-tags/) on Bitrise: this Env Var stores the tag used to trigger the build. "%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_GIT_COMMIT" content="`$BITRISE_GIT_COMMIT`: The commit hash of the Git commit that triggered the build, when applicable. There is no commit hash, for example, in the case of a pull request build. "%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_GIT_MESSAGE" content="`$BITRISE_GIT_MESSAGE`: The commit message, pull request title or the message you specified if you triggered the build manually. "%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISEIO_GIT_REPOSITORY_OWNER" content="`$BITRISEIO_GIT_REPOSITORY_OWNER`: The owner of the Git repository of the app (for example, `bitrise-io`). "%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISEIO_GIT_REPOSITORY_SLUG" content="`$BITRISEIO_GIT_REPOSITORY_SLUG`: The slug of the Git repository of the app (for example, `devcenter`). "%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_PULL_REQUEST" content="`$BITRISE_PULL_REQUEST`: The ID of the pull request that triggered a build. Not applicable, of course, if the build was not triggered by a pull request."%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISEIO_PULL_REQUEST_REPOSITORY_URL" content="`$BITRISEIO_PULL_REQUEST_REPOSITORY_URL`: The URL of the repository from where the pull request has been sent."%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISEIO_PULL_REQUEST_MERGE_BRANCH" content="`$BITRISEIO_PULL_REQUEST_MERGE_BRANCH`: The pre-merge branch - if the Git hosting provider supports and provides the pre-merged state of a pull request on a special merge branch. "%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISEIO_PULL_REQUEST_HEAD_BRANCH" content="`$BITRISEIO_PULL_REQUEST_HEAD_BRANCH`: The pull request head branch, if the Git hosting provider system supports and provides this. This special git ref should point to the source of the pull request. "%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_PROVISION_URL" content="`$BITRISE_PROVISION_URL`: The URL of the Apple provisioning profiles uploaded to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io). If there is more than one provisioning profile uploaded for your app, a pipe character separates the URLs in the list (`|`).

This is only relevant for iOS apps and for cross-platform apps with iOS versions. "%}

{% include collapse.html title="$BITRISE_CERTIFICATE_URL" content="`$BITRISE_CERTIFICATE_URL`: The URL of the Apple certificates uploaded to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io). If there is more than one certificate uploaded for your app, a pipe character separates the URLs in the list (`|`).
