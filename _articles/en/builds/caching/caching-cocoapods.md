Before you start, make sure you have the latest version of the **Cocoapods Install** Step in your Workflow.

1. Open your app's **Workflow Editor**.
2. Insert the **Cache:Pull** Step after the **Git Clone** but before the **Cocoapods Install** Steps.

   IMPORTANT: Make sure that your Step is version 1.0.0 or newer. With the older versions, you have to manually specify paths for caching.
3. Insert the **Cache:Push** step to the very end of your workflow.

And that is all you have to do! If you wish to use an earlier version of the **Cache** Steps, you can find more information [here](https://discuss.bitrise.io/t/how-to-cache-cocoapods-dependencies/193).
