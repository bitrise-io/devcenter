Bitrise Checks is a Github app which provides an extended version of the classic status checks Bitrise sends back to GitHub. Bitrise Checks include a Bitrise build summary and a check status. You can view Bitrise Checks if you click the **Details** link of a pull request on GitHub. It unfolds the detailed build summary and build status Bitrise Checks attaches to your pull request on the **Checks** tab of GitHub.

There can be three different check statuses:

* Success.
* Failed.
* Action required (in the case of manual pull request approval).

## Installing Bitrise Checks

Using Bitrise Checks is just a few clicks away. Let's do this!

1. Select your organization's app on your [Dashboard](https://app.bitrise.io/dashboard/builds).
2. Select the **Settings** tab of your app.
3. Click the **install our app to your GitHub repository** LINK in the **ENABLE GITHUB CHECKS** toggle's description. Don't toggle the switch just yet, since you first need to install Bitrise Checks. We will get to enabling the toggle [later](/builds/bitrise-checks-on-github-checks/#enabling-github-checks).

   This link will take you to GitHub's **Bitrise Checks** installation page.
4. On the **Install Bitrise Checks** page, select the user or organization you want to add Bitrise Checks to.

5. Decide if you wish to install Bitrise Checks to all your repositories or just to a selected few. With this you grant rights to Bitrise Checks to integrate with your repository and use GitHub Checks to display check results.

6. In the GitHub prompt, provide your GitHub password.

If all goes well, you land on the **Bitrise Checks** page of GitHub. You should see a blue note at the top-left corner of the page that Bitrise Checks has been successfully installed on your GitHub account.

## Enabling GitHub Checks

All there's left to do is enabling GitHub Checks on your app's page on [Bitrise](https://app.bitrise.io/dashboard/builds).

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Enabling GitHub Checks is limited" content="Please note that only Organization owners and app admins can enable this toggle on the **Settings** page of the app."%}

1. Go to your organization's [Dashboard](https://app.bitrise.io/dashboard/builds).
2. Click the app whose GitHub repository you've installed the Bitrise Checks to.
3. Go to the **Settings** tab of the app.
4. Toggle the **ENABLE GITHUB CHECKS** switch to the right.

![{{ page.title }}](/img/enabled-toggle-githubchecks.jpg) Why can't you toggle the **ENABLE GITHUB CHECKS** switch?

* You cannot toggle the switch unless you install Bitrise Checks FIRST. Once it's done, you can go ahead and toggle the switch to the right to enable it.
* If you have renamed or moved the GitHub repository of an app which has already been added to Bitrise and you have installed Bitrise Checks on it. The repository's GitHub URL has obviously changed. Why bother? **ENABLE GITHUB CHECKS** switch can only work if the URL on Github and on Bitrise fully match (no redirect URL is allowed). So in this case, you have to manually update the **REPOSITORY URL** of your app on the **Settings** tab with the new GitHub URL.

  ![{{ page.title }}](/img/repository-url-change.jpg)

And you're done! Now any pull request you open to your app on GitHub will be validated with Bitrise Checks and a build will get automatically started on Bitrise (if the [pull request trigger](/builds/triggering-builds/trigger-pull-request/) is properly set on Bitrise).

You can easily get to your app's page on Bitrise. If you click on the build summary or on **View more details on Bitrise Checks** link on the **Checks** tab, you'll quickly get to your app's Build page.

### Switching to Bitrise Checks

If you have been already using status checks on pull requests prior to merging, it must have been the `ci/bitrise/...` check system. To be able to use Bitrise Checks, you have to manually switch from `ci/bitrise/...` to **Bitrise** to access those detailed checks. Let's see how!

![{{ page.title }}](/img/checks-pending.png)

1. Go to the **Settings** tab of your repository.
2. Click **Branches** on the side menu. Under **Require status checks to pass before merging**, you can see `ci/bitrise/...` as the selected checks system.

   ![{{ page.title }}](/img/require-status-checks.png)
3. Select **Bitrise** instead of `ci/bitrise/...`.
4. Merge a pull request.

## Disabling Github Checks

You can easily disable GitHub Checks on Bitrise if you toggle the **ENABLE GITHUB CHECKS** switch to the left on the **Settings** page of the app.

If you decide to uninstall Bitrise Checks from your GitHub account, you can click the **Uninstall** button on the [Install GitHub Apps](https://github.com/settings/installations/) page.
