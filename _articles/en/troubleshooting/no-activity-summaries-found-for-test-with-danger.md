## The issue

When running Danger with the xcov plugin, you may get some form of the following error message:

    2019/01/01 00:00:00 no activity summaries found for test:

## The solution

This is a consequence of how the **Xcode Test for iOS** Step works: it generates an .xcresult bundle and exports it to the `$BITRISE_XCRESULT_PATH`.

Xcov, by default, for the results bundle in its default location, not at `$BITRISE_XCRESULT_PATH`. Because of this your build will fail when using those tools. You need to configure them to look for the bundle in the location set by the Env Var. Hereâ€™s an example xcov setup:

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Plugin version" content="The xcov plugin must be version 1.6 or later: earlier versions do not allow specifying the exact path."%}

    xcov.report(
      scheme: 'ExampleScheme',
      workspace: 'example.xcworkspace',
      xccov_file_direct_path: ENV['BITRISE_XCRESULT_PATH'],
      include_targets: 'Example.app,ExampleShared.framework,ExampleWidget.appex'
    )
