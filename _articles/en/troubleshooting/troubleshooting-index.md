In this section, we offer you some ideas for how to debug your Bitrise builds. The guides deal with specific issues: take a look at them to check out if any of them solves your problem.

If your builds keep failing and you cannot find the answer, here's some "best practices" to keep in mind:

* It's always worth checking [our forums](https://discuss.bitrise.io). Our users are active and our support staff are monitoring the threads constantly: you can search for similar issues as yours or open a new thread.
* [The build logs](/builds/build-logs/) often give you reasonably informative error messages. These are worth looking up, especially if they are produced by widely-used tools, such as Xcode.
* [Enabling the Bitrise Support User](/troubleshooting/enabling-bitrise-support-user/) before contacting support helps us: we can take a look at your Workflow directly, and even test some solutions right away. Without that, we can only see the build log you send us.

If you think a certain issue, with its solution(s), should be included in the guides in this section, let us know either by contacting support or opening a thread on our forums!
