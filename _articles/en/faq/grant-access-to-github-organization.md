{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Can't see `Grant` button next to app under `Organization access`" content="If there's no `Grant` button but only a **red cross** icon next to the Organization in the `Organization access` that means that **the access was previously granted but then it was revoked**. You can fix this by first selecting the Organization under `Organization settings` on the left side, then clicking `Third-party access`. You can see `Bitrise` with `Denied` access. Click the pencil icon and `Grant access` to Bitrise. Now you can go back to your `Authorized OAuth Apps` and click on Bitrise. You should see a green tick instead of the red cross icon next to your Organization. "%}

You can see the Organization and its repositories if you go back to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io), click on your avatar, select `Add new App` and hit `Next`.

{% include message_box.html type="note" title="Repository is a fork of another private repository" content="
If the repository is a fork of another private repository which belongs to **(another) Organization**, you have to repeat these steps and grant access for Bitrise for the Organization **which owns the original repository**. This is a GitHub limitation: to be able to access a private repository fork you have to grant access for the service (Bitrise) in both repositories; in the fork and in the original repository/Organization too.
