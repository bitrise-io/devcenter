You probably did not grant access to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) when you authenticated with GitHub to access the organization (or a repository owned by the organization).

To fix this you should follow this guide: [Grant access to a GitHub Organization](/faq/grant-access-to-github-organization).
