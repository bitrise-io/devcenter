{% include message_box.html type="important" title="My message" content="The Trace beta phase has ended. We have decided to remove access to Trace Beta, for now, so we can make the necessary enhancements before moving forward with the general release.

On the 1st October 2021, we will be closing access to the Trace dashboards, so you will no longer be able to view your app performance data.

The SDK will continue to function as before, so this won't add any instability to the functioning of your app. We recommend removing the SDK in preparation for this, but you donâ€™t have to rush because of a worry you might have about the impact on your users."%}

Trace is a Bitrise add-on designed to monitor your applications from the perspective of its end users. It comes with out-of-the-box performance monitoring, giving you insight into how the app is performing across the entire install base.

The core philosophy of Trace is to simplify how mobile product teams:

* Detect the problem: know about issues before your users report them.
* Assess the impact: focus on resolving the issues that have the greatest impact on your users.
* Trace the cause: spend less time trying to reproduce issues.
