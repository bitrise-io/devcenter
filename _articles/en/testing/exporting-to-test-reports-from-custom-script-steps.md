[Test Reports](/testing/test-reports/) allows you to view all your test results in a convenient way. By default, five [Steps](/steps-and-workflows/steps-and-workflows-index/) support the Test Reports add-on:

* **Xcode Test for iOS**
* **Android Unit Test**
* **iOS Device Testing**
* **Virtual Device Testing for Android**
* **Flutter Test**

To export the test results generated by any other Step to the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step, you have two options:

* We strongly recommend using our [**Export test results to the Test reports add-on** Step](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations/steps/custom-test-results-export): this Step locates the test results based on your inputs.
* You can configure your own custom **Script** Step that creates and exports the necessary files.

## Using the Export test results to the Test reports add-on Step

You can use the **Export test results to the Test reports add-on** Step to make sure your test results appear in the Test Reports add-on, even if you use Steps that don’t automatically export their results.

With the correct configuration, the Step finds the test results in your app’s repository, and puts them in the export directory.

1. Go to your app’s page on [bitrise.io](http://bitrise.io/).
2. Go to **Workflows** to open the Workflow Editor.
3. From the **WORKFLOW** menu, select the Workflow you use to run your tests.
4. Add the **Export test results to the Test reports add-on** Step AFTER the testing Step.
5. In the **The name of the test** input, set the name of the test.  
   The test results will be under this name in the Test Reports add-on.
6. In the **Path where custom test results reside** input, set the path where your test results can be found.  
   ![](/img/bitrise_workflow_editor-2.png)  
   We recommend setting a folder here, though you can also set a specific filepath. The default value is the source directory of your app. Example patterns:
   * If your app’s root directory is app: `app/build/test-results/testDemoDebugUnitTest/`
   * If your test results are within an app folder but app is not the root directory: ./app/build/test-results/testDemoDebugUnitTest/
7. In the **Test result search pattern** input, set a pattern that matches your test result file.

   This search pattern is used to search every file and folder of the path that was set in the **Path where custom test results reside** input.  
   If there is more than one match, the Step will export the first match with a warning in the logs. If you set a specific filepath in the previous input, just set * here.  
   Example patterns:
   * Matching all files within the base path: `*`
   * Matching all files within a given directory of the base path: `*/build/test-results/testDemoDebugUnitTest/*`
8. In the **Step’s test result directory** input, make sure the path is correct.  
   Do NOT modify this input’s value: this is the folder where the **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step will look for the test results to export them. It should be set to the `$BITRISE_TEST_RESULT_DIR` Env Var.
9. Make sure you have a **Deploy to Bitrise.io** Step in your Workflow.

## Using custom scripts to export test results

You can use your own scripts in a **Script** Step to export your test results. You just need to make sure that:

* Your test results are in a JUnit XML format.
* You place the results in the $BITRISE_TEST_RESULT_DIR, which is an Environment Variable pointing to the correct path.
* You place a `test-info.json` file in each test result's sub-directory.

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="The `test-info.json` file" content="The `test-info.json` file must have the test name defined in it. Each test result should have its own `test-info.json` file. The value of test-name will appear as the name of the test run on the Test Reports page.

    // Test Name ...
    { \"test-name\":\"My first test\" }
 "%}

Here's an example script to export your test results: 

```
#!/bin/env bash
set -ex

# Creating a sub-directory for the test run within the BITRISE_TEST_RESULT_DIR:

test_run_dir="$BITRISE_TEST_RESULT_DIR/result_dir_1"
mkdir "$test_run_dir"

# Exporting the JUnit XML test report:

cp "MY/TEST/REPORT/XML/FILE/PATH.xml" "$test_run_dir/UnitTest.xml"

# Creating the test-info.json file with the name of the test run defined:

echo '{"test-name":"MY TEST RUN NAME"}' >> "$test_run_dir/test-info.json"
```

If all goes well, you should be able to see your test results on the [Test Reports](/testing/test-reports/) page.
