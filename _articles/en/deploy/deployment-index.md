Deployment can mean a number of things on Bitrise: you can deploy your app to test devices, or to bitrise.io, with a public install page that you can freely distribute so that anyone can test the app; you can deploy your app to a simulator, to conduct UI testing, for example; and of course you can deploy your apps to online stores, such as the App Store or the Google Play Store.

Our Deployment section is divided into two subsections:

* [iOS deployment](/deploy/ios-deploy/ios-deploy-index/)
* [Android deployment](/deploy/android-deploy/android-deployment-index/)

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="Deploying with Ship" content="The deploying guides in the above sections talk about deploying with the official Bitrise deployment Steps. 

We recommend checking out Ship, our deployment solution that aims to save you a lot of headache in publishing your apps: [Deploying with Ship](/deploy/ship/)."%}

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Cross-platform apps" content="Don't worry: this does not mean that only native iOS and Android apps can be deployed using Bitrise. The guides are just as useful for deploying cross-platform apps. For the specifics, check out the guide for your platform type in the [Getting started](/getting-started/index/) section."%}
