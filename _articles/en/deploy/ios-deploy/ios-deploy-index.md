Once you built your app and ran unit tests and UI tests on it, it's time to deploy it.

To deploy an iOS app to any platform, you need:

* [to archive your Xcode project and export a signed .ipa file](/code-signing/ios-code-signing/create-signed-ipa-for-xcode/)

Our guides delve into the specifics of these two basic requirements and show how to use our Steps to deploy the app in the exact way you want to!
