## Introduction to Applivery

[Applivery](https://www.applivery.com) is a mobile app distribution platform for iOS and Android that provides a powerful mobile app management and distribution system to simplify app delivery for both testers and employees, with a focus on an easy-to-use experience.

Applivery has many features to better manage your in-development and production-ready apps that will help speed up your development, get better feedback and deliver better applications.

Some of the features are:

* Single or Multi App customized App Stores with a seamless user experience for non-technical users.
* Multi-track and fully customized app distribution with multiple security configurations including SSO, non-registered users, password protected and unlisted apps.
* Automatic and forced in-app updates.
* Feedback and bug reporting.

Combined with Bitrise, you can cover the entire development life cycle, from testing and building to delivery and feedback.
