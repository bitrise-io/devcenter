You can set up webhooks so that Bitrise automatically triggers a build of your app whenever you perform a specified action, such as a code push or a pull request. For GitLab, all you have to do is register your `bitrise-webhooks` URL as a Webhook in your [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com) repository.

You can register a webhook either automatically or manually. This guide walks you through the process of manually registering a webhook. [Read more about automatic webhook registration](/webhooks/index#setting-up-incoming-webhooks-automatically).

## Get the webhook URL for GitLab

1. Go to the Code tab of your app's page and in the **INCOMING WEBHOOKS** menu, click **SETUP MANUALLY**.
2. Select **GitLab** from the dropdown menu.

## Set up webhook on GitLab

1. Open your project on [GitLab.com](https://www.gitlab.com)
2. Go to **Settings** of the project.
3. Select **Integrations**.

   * Merge request events

6. Click **Add webhook**.

That's all! The next time you push code, push a new tag or create/update a merge request a build will be triggered (if you have Trigger mapping defined for the event(s) on Bitrise).
