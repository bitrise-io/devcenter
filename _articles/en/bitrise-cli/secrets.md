Secrets can be accessed and used in a similar way as app Env Vars, the main difference is that Secrets are not stored as part of the build configuration.

When you run a build locally, with the Bitrise CLI, the Secrets are read from a `.bitrise.secrets.yml` file, which is expected to be in the same directory where the `bitrise.yml` is, and where you run the `bitrise run` command.

If you want to store your Secrets somewhere else, you can specify the location of the Secrets file with the `--inventory` flag of the `bitrise run` command. For example, `bitrise run my-workflow --inventory /path/to/secrets.yml`.

{% include message_box.html type="warning" title="Make sure to `gitignore` your Secrets file" content=" As a best practice, you should always make sure that the `.bitrise.secrets.yml` is added to your `.gitignore`, so that it will never be committed into your repository! The best is if you `gitignore` everything that starts with `.bitrise`, which can be done by adding the line: `.bitrise*` to your `.gitignore` file. "%}

The format of the Secrets YAML file is really simple. It has to include a root `envs:` item and then the list of Environment Variables.

Example:

```yaml
envs:
- SECRET_ENV_ONE: first Secret value
- SECRET_ENV_TWO: second Secret value
```

The Environment Variables defined in the Secrets file can be used just like any other Environment Variable, so, if you save the above example into a `.bitrise.secrets.yml` file, and you have a `bitrise.yml` file in the same directory with the content:

```yaml
format_version: 1.3.1
default_step_lib_source: https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib.git

workflows:
  test:
    steps:
    - script@1.1.3:
        inputs:
        - content: |
            #!/bin/bash
            echo "SECRET_ENV_ONE: ${SECRET_ENV_ONE}"
            echo "SECRET_ENV_TWO: ${SECRET_ENV_TWO}"
```

You can just `bitrise run test` in the directory, and you'll see that the Script
step will print the values specified in the secrets file:

    ...

    |                                                                              |

As Secrets are the first Environment Variables processed when you execute a `bitrise run` command, you can use the Environment Variables everywhere in your `bitrise.yml`, for example in `App Env Vars` (`app: envs:` in the [bitrise.yml](/bitrise-cli/basics-of-bitrise-yml/)),
[Workflow environment variables](/bitrise-cli/workflows/#defining-workflow-specific-parameters-and-environment-variables)
and Step inputs too.

## Secret filtering with Bitrise CLI

Bitrise CLI automatically filters your secret Env Vars and prints `[REDACTED]` with newlines after the key so that the Secret Env Vars are NOT VISIBLE in the build log. This applies to both private and public apps.

{% include message_box.html type="warning" title="Build configuration custom Env Vars are exposed" content="
You can specify an Env Var you wish to overwrite in your Workflow if you click **Start/Schedule a Build** for your build and select the **Advanced** option in the **Build configuration** pop-up window. Note that any Env Var you set in **Custom Environment Variables (optional)** section will not be handled as Secret Env Vars, and therefore, they will be visible in the build logs! You can also check them in **Build parameters** if you click **More details** on your Build's page. "%}

### Turning secret filtering off

If you turn secret filtering off and your build log contains any secrets, then those values will be visible in your build log. 

{% include message_box.html type="warning" title="Risk ahead" content="Since this is a potential security risk, we DO NOT RECOMMEND turning secret filtering off. "%}

1. Go to Workflow Editor by clicking the **Workflow** tab of your app on [bitrise.io](https://app.bitrise.io/dashboard/builds).
2. Click the **Secrets** tab.
3. Click **Add new** to register the `BITRISE_SECRET_FILTERING` secret Environment Variable with false value.
4. Click **Save**.
