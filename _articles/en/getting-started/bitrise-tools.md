Here is a list of our open source tools maintained by the Bitrise team.

## Bitrise CLI tools

### bitrise

The Bitrise CLI which is used on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) to run builds. Install it on your own Mac/Linux and run your builds locally!

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="Find out more on Bitrise CLI" content=" Check out its [GitHub](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise) page or dig deeper in our [Bitrise CLI docs](/bitrise-cli/index/)."%}

### stepman

Our [Step Collection Manager](https://github.com/bitrise-io/stepman) used for managing the Step Library, including downloading and sharing [Steps](/steps-and-workflows/getting-started-steps/).

### envman

The [Environment Variable Manager](https://github.com/bitrise-io/envman) used by the Bitrise CLI to isolate and manage [Environment Variables (Env Vars)](/builds/available-environment-variables/) during the build. Our envman tool can be used independently of the Bitrise CLI if you want to connect tools, where one tool saves the Env Var and the other one uses it.

## Bitrise CLI core plugins
