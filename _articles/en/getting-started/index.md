Bitrise is powerful and complex - but getting started is easy and intuitive! You can kick off your first build within minutes of signing up. Let's go over what you need to do make that happen!

## Signing up to Bitrise

First of all, you need a Bitrise account. Choose one of the following to sign up:

* [Email](/getting-started/signing-up/signing-up-with-email)
* [GitHub](/getting-started/signing-up/signing-up-with-github)
* [GitLab](/getting-started/signing-up/signing-up-with-gitlab)
* [Bitbucket](/getting-started/signing-up/signing-up-with-bitbucket)

Signing up with either of the Git service providers means you connect your Bitrise account to your account on that service provider. With a connected account, you can easily grant Bitrise access to any of your repositories on that account.

After signing up, you can connect your Bitrise account to all of the three supported Git service providers. For example, after you signed up with GitHub, you can connect your Bitrise account to both your GitLab and Bitbucket accounts, too, and access any repositories you have on those accounts.

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="Trial after signing up" content="If you sign up for a free account, you will automatically be granted a two-week trial on our Developer plan. This includes:

* 45 minutes of build time
* 1000 builds a month
* a maximum of 100 team members

Read more about the available plans on the [Pricing](https://www.bitrise.io/pricing/teams) page!"%}

## Adding apps

[Add a new app](/getting-started/adding-a-new-app/index) any time by clicking the `+` symbol on the top menu bar and then selecting `Add app` from the dropdown menu.

### Privacy

Set your app's privacy setting to either **private** or [**public**](/getting-started/adding-a-new-app/public-apps):

* Private apps can be accessed only by you, your organization members and team members.
* Public apps expose their build logs and their `bitrise.yml` file to everyone.

### Connecting a repository

Tell Bitrise where the code of your app is stored. You can either:

* [Connect a repository from a connected GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket account](/getting-started/adding-a-new-app/connecting-a-repository). Bitrise will then automatically display all the available repositories from the selected service, all you need to do is choose one.
* Manually add the location of the source code: choose the `Other/Manual` option then paste an **HTTPS git clone URL**.
* You can also use a repository that is on [a self-hosted GitLab instance](getting-started/signing-up/self-hosted-gitlab).

**Why does Bitrise need write permissions on Github/Bitbucket/GitLab?** Connecting your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket account gives Bitrise write permission to the repositories. There are two things that Bitrise couldn't do without it:

* Adding an SSH key to the selected repository
* Registering a Webhook for the repository

### Setting up repository access

[Set up an SSH key to access the selected repository](/getting-started/adding-a-new-app/setting-up-ssh-keys). This is required for private apps to ensure Bitrise can clone the repository. You can:

* auto-add the SSH key Bitrise generated.
* copy the public key Bitrise generated.
* use your own SSH keypair. Make sure your private key is an RSA key without a passphrase.

Public apps cannot have SSH keys.

### Validating and configuring the project

After setting up repository access, type the branch of the repository you wish to use and click `Next`.

[Bitrise will scan and validate your repository and set up a project configuration](/getting-started/adding-a-new-app/setting-up-configuration) based on the results. If the validation fails, you can set up the project manually.

### Webhook setup

[Register a webhook](/webhooks/index/) immediately so Bitrise can start a build every time you push code into your repository. You can skip webhook setup when creating a new app: you can always set up webhooks later.

## Builds and workflows

Once you added an app, your first build will be kicked off automatically. This means running a workflow which is a collection of Steps. Steps represent a block of script execution with predefined input and output variables and they are the heart of Bitrise. You can create new workflows, chain workflows together. You can also modify Step inputs, add and remove Steps to and from workflows.

* [Workflows](/getting-started/getting-started-workflows)
* [Steps](/getting-started/getting-started-steps)

## Teams and organizations

Once you set up a new app, you can [start inviting team members](/team-management/index). If you have a Developer or an Organization plan, you can have unlimited team members!

You can also [create organizations](/team-management/organizations/creating-org) if you are on one of our Organization plans. Organizations allow you to manage entire teams quickly and effectively.
