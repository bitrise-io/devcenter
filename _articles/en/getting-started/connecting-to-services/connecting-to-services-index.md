To use all the features Bitrise offers, you might want to connect to services such as your Git provider or to any of the Apple services you use. 

Our guides explain how to connect your GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket account to your Bitrise account (or a self-hosted GitLab instance to your Bitrise account if your Organization uses it). You can connect only one account from a certain Git provider to Bitrise. You can disconnect and connect a new from another Git provider at any time.

Check out our guides:

- [Connecting self-hosted GitLab instances](/getting-started/connecting-to-services/self-hosted-gitlab/)

You will also learn what authentication methods you can use to connect Bitrise with your Apple services such as App Store Connect or Apple Developer Portal. Whether you use Apple ID and password or API key authentication, we got you covered.
