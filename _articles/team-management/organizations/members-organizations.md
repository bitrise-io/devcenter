Organizations can have multiple **Groups**. Groups form the "backbones" of organizations: they contain the members of the organizations, they can be assigned to different applications owned by the organizations, with different roles assigned to the different groups. Being a member of an organization means being a member of one of the groups belonging to the organization.

For example, let's say the organization called _TestOrg_ owns an app called _TestApp_. _TestOrg_ has the following groups:

* `Senior Developers` - they are assigned to _TestApp_ with an `Admin` role. Members of this group can assign other groups to the app or add outside contributors, change app settings, manage roles and workflows.
* `Developers` - they are assigned to _TestApp_ with a `Developer` role. Members of this group can run builds, view build logs and view builds.
* `Testers` - they are assigned to _TestApp_ with a `Tester / QA` role. They can only view builds.

## Creating groups for organizations

1. Sign in with an account that is an **owner** of the organization and open its profile page.
2. Go to your organization's profile page: click `Switch Profile` on the top left corner and select the organization you need.

## Adding members to organizations

1. Sign in with an account that is an **owner** of the organization and open its profile page.
2. Go to your organization's profile page: click `Switch Profile` on the top left corner and select the organization you need.

   * If you enter an email address, click the `Enter` symbol on the right to send the invitation.

From the `Team` tab you can also access all the functions to manage groups. You simply have to click `MANAGE GROUP` to the right of the group members, and click the action you need in the pop-up window, including removing the group from the app.

## Removing members from organizations

Members can be removed from the entire organization or from one of the groups belonging to an organization. In practice, this means that a single member can be removed from working on any of the apps belonging to the organization or only from selected apps.

### Removing group members

1. Sign in with an account that is an **owner** of the organization and open its profile page.
2. Go to your organization's profile page: click `Switch Profile` on the top left corner and select the organization you need.

### Removing members from the entire organization

Removing members from the entire organization removes them from all the groups they are part of in the organization and they can no longer work on any of the apps unless they are invited back, either as a group member or as an outside contributor.

1. Sign in with an account that is an **owner** of the organization and open its profile page.
2. Go to your organization's profile page: click `Switch Profile` on the top left corner and select the organization you need.
