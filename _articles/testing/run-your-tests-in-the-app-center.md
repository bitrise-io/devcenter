Upload and schedule tests on the Visual Studio App Center for your projects. The following testing frameworks are available:

* Appium
* Espresso
* Calabash
* Xamarin.UITest
* XCUITest

1. In the Workflow Editor, [add](/getting-started/getting-started-workflows/) the `App Center upload and schedule tests` step to your workflow.

   The step has multiple required inputs. You can find the value of these inputs by setting up your test on the Visual Studio App Center.
2. Log in to the App Center. 
3. [Prepare your test for upload](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/appcenter/test-cloud/preparing-for-upload/).
4. Create an [App Center](https://appcenter.ms/apps) project.
5. Navigate to `Test runs` tab and start a `New test run`:
   * Select the devices you want to test your app on.
   * Configure the test run:  choose a test series, a system language and a test framework.
   * **On the** `**Submit**` **tab you will find every required input for the step in the** `**Upload and schedule test**` **section**.
   * Click on `Done`.
6. On Bitrise, open the Workflow Editor and fill in the required inputs of the Step. You will need to:
