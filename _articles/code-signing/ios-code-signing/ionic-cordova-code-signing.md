Naturally, Bitrise supports iOS applications built with either **Ionic** or **Cordova**. However, the code signing process is slightly different compared to a "native" Xcode project.

Bitrise supports both manual and automatic provisioning for Ionic and Cordova apps as well - and once again, the processes are somewhat different.

### Ionic/Cordova code signing with manual provisioning

1. Generate the native Xcode project locally from your Ionic or Cordova project by calling `cordova platform add ios` or `ionic cordova platform add ios`.
2. Use our `codesigndoc` tool to [collect the code signing files](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/code-signing/ios-code-signing/collecting-files-with-codesigndoc/).
3. Upload the files to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

   You can do this either on the website UI or with the `codesigndoc` tool itself.

4. Make sure you have the `Certificate and profile installer` step in your workflow.
5. Add the `Generate cordova build configuration` step to your Workflow. It must come after the `Certificate and profile installer` step.
6. Fill in the required input for the step. Please note that both the `Code Signing Identity` and the `Provisioning Profile` are required inputs for iOS apps even though they are not marked as such.

   * `Build configuration`: you can set it to either `debug` or `release`.
   * `Code Sign Identity`: enter a Developer or a Distribution identity.
   * `Provisioning Profile`: enter the appropriate Provisioning Profile.
   * `Packaging Type`: this controls what type of build is generated by Xcode. Set the type of code signing you need.
7. Add the `Cordova archive` or the `Ionic archive` step to your workflow.
8. Fill in the required inputs.
   * The `Platform` input needs to be set to: `device`.
   * The `Build command configuration` input must match the `Build configuration` input of the `Generate cordova build configuration` step.

   This step must come after the `Generate cordova build configuration` step in the workflow.
9. Run your build!

### Ionic/Cordova code signing with auto provisioning

1. Make sure your .p12 signing certificates are uploaded to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

   If you use `codesigndoc` to collect the files, note that you can tell the tool to export only the certificates, by calling:

   ``` bash
   codesigndoc scan --certs-only xcode
   ```

   `codesigndoc` can also upload the files to the website, or you can do that manually.
2. Add the `Cordova prepare` or the `Ionic prepare` step to your Workflow. These steps call the `platform rm` and `platform add` commands.
3. Add the `iOS Auto Provision` step to your workflow. Please make sure it's the latest version!

   The step will export:
   * the project's development team
   * the installed codesign identity's name
   * the installed provisioning profile.

   These will be used by the `Generate cordova build configuration` step.

   **IMPORTANT**: If you have both the `Certificate and profile installer` and the `iOS Auto Provisioning` steps in your workflow, your build will fail.
4. Add the `Generate cordova build configuration` step to your Workflow. Configure the step to use the code signing settings exported by the `iOS Auto Prevision` step:

	__Development distribution example__:
    
	```yaml
	- generate-cordova-build-configuration:
    	inputs:
        - development_team: $BITRISE_DEVELOPER_TEAM 
        - package_type: development 
        - code_sign_identity: $BITRISE_DEVELOPMENT_CODESIGN_IDENTITY 
        - provisioning_profile: $BITRISE_DEVELOPMENT_PROFILE 
        - configuration: debug
    ```

   __Production distribution example__:
   
   ```yaml 
   - generate-cordova-build-configuration:
       inputs:
       - development_team: $BITRISE_DEVELOPER_TEAM 
       - package_type: app-store 
       - code_sign_identity: $BITRISE_PRODUCTION_CODESIGN_IDENTITY 
       - provisioning_profile: $BITRISE_PRODUCTION_PROFILE 
       - configuration: release
    ```

5. Add the `Cordova Archive` or the `Ionic Archive` step to your workflow.
6. Fill in the required inputs.
   * The `Platform` input needs to be set to: `device`.
   * The `Build command configuration` input must match the `Build configuration` input of the `Generate cordova build configuration` step.

7. Set the `Should remove platforms as prepare step?` to `false`. This is crucial: it ensures the step will not remove and re-add the platform of the native projects generated in the `Cordova prepare` or the `Ionic prepare` step.
8. Run your build!
