IOS FEATURES
Out of the box support for your native iOS projects. Build, test and deploy with ease.

———

# Project scanner
Adding your iOS app to Bitrise takes less than 60 seconds. Our scanner automatically detects platform, dependencies and configuration and creates a base workflow that builds, tests and deploys your app on the first build.

———

# Multiple Xcode versions
You can select from multiple stacks with different Xcode versions to test your app on. We constantly update and test each virtual machine configuration so your builds wouldn’t break.

———

# Superfast Xcode beta updates
We do our best to provide the latest Xcode betas 48 hours after release. Our workflow specific stack setting makes doing a dry run on a beta releases a breeze.

# Effortless code signing
## Automatic provisioning profile management
iOS code signing is not something anyone likes doing or even think about. Connect your Apple Developer Account and let us handle your profiles. Just set the export method and you’re good to go, no messing about.

## Codesigndoc
If you prefer uploading your signing files manually, don’t worry, we got you. Run a simple command in your terminal, and our friendly neighborhood Codesigndoc will collect and export all your files needed to sign your app.

# Smart derived data caching
Make your builds 60% faster by caching your derived data the right way. All you need to do is add our Recursive touch and Cache steps and we’ll figure out the rest.

# Run your unit and UI tests
Drop the Xcode Test step into your workflow and we’ll run your test cases.

# Secure file storage
## Secret environment variables
Secrets are stored encrypted and only exposed during build or when you’d like to reveal them on the UI. Your credentials and API keys for connected services are safe with us.

## Make secrets & files protected
You can set any secret env or file, such as provisioning profile, certificate or keystore as protected. Protected secrets cannot be revealed on the UI and such files cannot be downloaded by anyone from your team.

# Distribute your app automatically
## Deploy to testers
If you are looking for an easy way to send your app to testers, you can use Bitrise deploy. This will send a link to specific emails where your testers can install the IPA.

## Send straight to iTunes Connect / TestFlight
You can automatically send your App Store signed apps to iTunes Connect.

## Deploy to third parties
If you’re already using a service for deployment, fear not, you can keep using that. From HockeyApp to Fabric, we’ve got them all.
