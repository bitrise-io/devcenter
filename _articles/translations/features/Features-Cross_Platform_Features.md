CROSS-PLATFORM FEATURES
Out of the box support for Xamarin, React Native, Ionic & Cordova projects.

# Project scanner
Adding your cross-platform app to Bitrise takes less than 60 seconds. Our scanner automatically detects platform, dependencies and configuration and creates a base workflow that builds, tests and deploys your app on the first build. Support for popular dependency managers and frameworks
NuGet
FAKE
CAKE
NPM
Yarn

# Build for iOS and Android from the same project
Create an iOS and an Android specific workflow and keep everything neat and tidy. You can select a build stack for your whole project or even for a specific workflow.

# Distribute your app automatically
## Deploy to testers
If you are looking for an easy way to send your app to testers, you can use Bitrise deploy. This will send a link to specific email addresses so that your testers can install the .IPA.

## Send straight to the store
You can automatically send your apps to Google Play or iTunes Connect.

## Deploy to third parties
If you already use another service for deployment, fear not, you can keep using that. From HockeyApp to TestFairy, we’ve got them all.

# Effortless code signing
## Codesigndoc for iOS
Run a simple command in your terminal, and our friendly neighborhood Codesigndoc will collect and export all your files needed to sign your app.

## Upload your keystore
To sign your Android project, simply upload your release keystore file, add the Sign APK step and you’re done - you can distribute your signed .APK anywhere.

# Secure file storage
## Secret environment variables
Secrets are stored encrypted and are only exposed during build or when you’d like to reveal them on the UI. Your credentials and API keys for connected services are safe with us.

## Make secrets & files protected
You can set any secret env or file, such as provisioning profile, certificate or keystore as protected. Protected secrets cannot be revealed on the UI and such files cannot be downloaded by anyone from your team.

## Dozens of integrations that work with your cross platform project
