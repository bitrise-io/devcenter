BITRISE DEPLOYMENT FEATURES
Use our own over-the-air deployment service to share your app quickly with your testers

# Add emails or tester groups
Specify individual email addresses, or send the install link to one of your predefined access groups, such as Admins, Developers or Testers.

# Get all your artifacts from the build’s page
If you use the Deploy to Bitrise.io step, all generated artifacts will be listed on the build’s page. You can view images or html reports inline, or download and distribute any generated apps (IPA or APK) right from the same page.

# Deploy multiple apps in the same build
When you are generating multiple flavors of the same app or you need apps signed differently, you can deploy multiple apps which you can access from the build’s page.

# Do you prefer a third party? We’ve got you.
