YOUR CHOICE OF WEAPON
## Build your apps for any platform
After connecting your repository, Bitrise scans and configures your project for any mobile platform, be it native or hybrid, so you can start shipping your app immediately.

———

FOR YOUR CONVENIENCE
## Workflows for every development stage
Forget scripting and create powerful workflows with reusable building blocks.

* Master
* Develop
* Feature

### Master
Once you ticked all the boxes, send your app straight to the App Store automatically.

### Develop
Run end-to-end unit and integration tests once a feature is merged and deploy your app internally for manual testing and QA.

### Feature/*
Run your unit tests for every push and get notified when something breaks right away

———

## Run the same config locally
Download your bitrise.yml and use our open source CLI locally to debug a build or to run your automations from the terminal.

### Chain workflows together
Specify workflows for repeat stages in your pipelines and connect them together seamlessly. See all your workflow chains at a glance on the UI.

### Specify a trigger for each workflow
Control which workflow to build when by setting up triggers to build for push, pull request or tag events on a specific branch.

### Open source integrations
Choose from 180+ integrations to craft workflows for any scenario. Build fails? Create a Jira ticket. New version deployed? Send the install link to Slack.

### Choose your weapon

BASED ON YOUR FEEDBACK
## Features you must love

### Automatic code signing
We know that iOS code signing is a pain. Connect your Apple Developer Account and let us handle your profiles. Just set the export method and you're good to go, no messing about.

### Bitrise deployment
Bitrise integrates with all the major third party beta testing and deployment services, but we wanted to provide an integrated solution to help you distribute your apps to your testers without the need of registering yet another account after signing up to Bitrise.

### Support by devs for devs
We don't just have a support staff, we have engineers, and you can talk to them whenever you want. Provided they aren't on a space walk or having tea with a Klingon (i.e. virtually always!)

### Smart caching done fast
Bitrise automatically configures caching right at project setup for all your dependencies. Adding source code or derived data caching is only a few clicks so you could go out bragging about your superfast build times.

### Security with no compromise
Every build runs on its own virtual machine, and all data is discarded at the end of the build. We also hired sharks with laser beams on their head, just in case. Click for our detailed security policy.

### Fast and reliable emulators
Run your Android UI tests on solid and snappy virtual devices. Bitrise fully integrates with Firebase Test Lab, showing your test reports with videos and screenshots right on build's page.
