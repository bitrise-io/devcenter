## 日本語訳のコントリビューターには限定Tシャツをプレゼント！ :jp:
As part of our commitment to the community, we’ll be localizing a good chunk of **Bitrise in Japanese**. There’s a bit of a challenge involved, though. Turns out, most translators have zero understanding of app development, which leads to translations that don’t actually do what they’re supposed to: help Japanese users on Bitrise. That’s where (hopefully) you come in:

Over the coming weeks, we hope some of our Japanese users will assist us in localizing a section of our DevCenter and some of the pages most critical to understanding how and why to use Bitrise.

How to contribute:
1. Choose the page you want to translate on https://devcenter.bitrise.io.
2. Fork the DevCenter repository: https://github.com/bitrise-io/devcenter.
3. Search for the page's markdown file in the the **\_articles/translations** folder and edit it (please don't change the filename)
4. If your chosen page is not included in the **translations** folder, you can find it in the **\_articles** folder and copy it to the **translations** folder.
5. We are checking pull requests daily

**If you contribute five or more paragraphs of quality text to the effort - either through one pull request (PR) of five paragraphs or five PRs of one paragraph each - before the end of October, we will send you a limited edition Bitrise T-shirt as a 'thank you' for helping us out. This will be a T-shirt reserved for Bitrise contributors, so not something you’ll be able to get by attending an event or just asking nicely.**

Thank you so much for your help!
