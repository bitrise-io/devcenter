# Help us localize, get a t-shirt :jp:
As part of our commitment to the community, we’ll be localising a good chunk of Bitrise in Japanese. There’s a bit of a challenge involved, though. Turns out, most translators have zero understanding of app development, which leads to translations that don’t actually do what they’re supposed to: Help Japanese users on Bitrise. That’s where (hopefully), you come in:

Over the coming weeks, we hope some of our Japanese users will assist us in localizing a section of our devcenter and some of the pages, most critical to understanding how and why to use Bitrise. Hub of these efforts is a Github repo set up specifically for this purpose. You can find that repo here.

**If you contribute 5 or more paragraphs of quality text to the effort - either through one PR of 5 paragraphs or 5 PR’s of one paragraph each - , we will send you a limited edition Bitrise t-shirt as a thank you for helping us out. This will be a t-shirt reserved for Bitrise contributors, so not something you’ll be able to get by attending an event or just asking nicely.**

Translating any page in the Devcenter is highly appreciated. These are the primary pages that would be the most helpful for new developers:
