# Help us localize, get a t-shirt :jp:
As part of our commitment to the community, we’ll be localizing a good chunk of Bitrise in Japanese. There’s a bit of a challenge involved, though. Turns out, most translators have zero understanding of app development, which leads to translations that don’t actually do what they’re supposed to: help Japanese users on Bitrise. That’s where (hopefully) you come in:

Over the coming weeks, we hope some of our Japanese users will assist us in localizing a section of our devcenter and some of the pages most critical to understanding how and why to use Bitrise. You can find these articles in the **Translations** folder of the [DevCenter repository](https://github.com/bitrise-io/devcenter). 

**If you contribute five or more paragraphs of quality text to the effort - either through one pull request (PR) of five paragraphs or five PRs of one paragraph each - , we will send you a limited edition Bitrise T-shirt as a 'thank you' for helping us out. This will be a T-shirt reserved for Bitrise contributors, so not something you’ll be able to get by attending an event or just asking nicely.**

Translating any page in the Devcenter is highly appreciated. These are the primary pages that would be the most helpful for new developers:
