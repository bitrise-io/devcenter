You are able to authenticate yourself with your GitLab user against **Bitrise**. It brings some practical benefits, like logging in with one click and of course you won't have to authorize your GitLab account when adding repositories hosted by these providers again.

{% include message_box.html type="note" title="Signing up with email address" content=" If you'd like to sign up with your email address, please follow the instructions in [signing up with email address](/getting-started/signing-up/signing-up-with-email). "%}

## Sign up

Go to the Sign up page by clicking `Sign up!` on the landing page of [bitrise.io](https://bitrise.io).

Select `GitLab` for authenticating yourself with this service.

## Authorize Bitrise

You have to authorize Bitrise before we can establish the connection. This means you give permission to Bitrise to access (read) your repositories.

If you press the `Authorize` button, you will be redirected to Bitrise.

## Finish signup

You will have to pick a username and a password for your Bitrise account. This way you are free from relying on the given service's availability. You are also able to connect more accounts from other Git providers like GitHub and Bitbucket, for example.

After that, you are ready to roll.

From now on, you are able to sign in with a click of a button. Choose your favorite!
