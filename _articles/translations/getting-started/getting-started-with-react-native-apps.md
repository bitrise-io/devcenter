title: Getting started with React Native apps
---
You can easily set up and configure your React Native project on Bitrise - the power is in your hands if you want to deploy both native versions or just one to distribution platforms! Your React Native repo can consists of an Android and an iOS project so configurations should be done as you would normally do with Android and iOS apps. When running a React Native project, you will see that first an Android, then an iOS build gets built. If your organization has more than one concurrency, you can have Android and iOS builds run simultaneously.

## Before setting up a React Native project

Make sure you have signed up to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) and can access your Bitrise account. If you haven't signed up yet, here are [4 ways](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/index#signing-up-to-bitrise) to do that.

## Add a React Native project to bitrise.io

In this tutorial, we're using this [sample app](https://github.com/bitrise-samples/sample-apps-react-native-ios-and-android). Let's start!

1. Log into [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).
2. Click `Add a new app`.
3. Select the privacy setting of your app: **private** and [**public**](/getting-started/adding-a-new-app/public-apps/).
4. Select the Git hosting service that hosts your repository, then find and select your own repository that hosts the project. Read more about [connecting your repository](/getting-started/adding-a-new-app/connecting-a-repository/).
5. When prompted to set up repository access, click `No, auto-add SSH key`. Read more about [SSH keys](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/adding-a-new-app/setting-up-ssh-keys/).
6. Type the name of the branch that includes your project’s configuration - master, for example, - then click `Next`.
7. At `Validating repository`, Bitrise runs an automatic repository scanner to set up the best configuration for your project.
8. At `Project build configuration`, select your preferred build configuration.
   * For React Native projects, you should see `React Native` as the selected **project type**. If the scanner fails and the project type is not selected automatically, you can [configure your project manually](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/adding-a-new-app/setting-up-configuration#manual-project-configuration). You can see that Android is automatically selected in `The root directory of an Android app`.
   * If your project consist of only one module, that module will be automatically selected for `Module`. If your project contains more than one module, you can pick a module, but we recommend the main one!
   * In `Select variant for building` field, select a variant that suits your project. Pick `Select All Variants` to build all variants. Pick `debug` or `release` if you wish to generate an APK or an .ipa file.
   * Select your Xcode project or Xcode Workspace path in the `Project (or Workspace) path field`.
   * `Select Scheme name`. The scanner validation will fail if you do not have a SHARED scheme in your  project. You can still point Bitrise manually to your Xcode scheme but  if it’s shared, we automatically detect it for you. [Read more about schemes and the possible issues with them!](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/troubleshooting/frequent-ios-issues/#xcode-scheme-not-found).
   * In `Select ipa export method`, select the export method of your .ipa file: `ad-hoc`, `app-store`, `development` or `enterprise` method.
9. At `Webhook setup`, register a Webhook so that Bitrise can automatically start a build every time you push code into your repository.

{% include message_box.html type="note" title="Settings tab" content=" These settings can be later modified at the `Settings` page of your app, except for the stack, which you can modify at the `Stack` tab of your Workflow Editor." %}

You have successfully set up your React Native project on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io)! Your first build gets kicked off automatically using the primary workflow. You can check the generated reports of the first build on the `APPS & ARTIFACTS` tab of your Build's page.

## Install dependencies

### Javascript dependencies

If Bitrise scanner has successfully scanned your project, `Run npm command` or `Run yarn command` steps will be included in your workflow.

In `Run npm command`, type `install` in the `npm command with arguments to run` input field so that it can add javascript dependencies to your project.

![](/img/run-nmp.png)

`Run yarn command` can install javascript dependencies automatically to your project without having to configure the step manually.

### Native dependencies

`Install missing Android tools` step installs the missing native dependencies  for your Android project - luckily this steps is by default included in your deploy workflow.

For iOS dependencies, you can add the `Run CocoaPods install` step to your workflow as it is not part of the workflow by default.

## Code signing

A React Native app can consists of two projects, an Android and an iOS - both must be properly code signed. If you click on the `Code Signing` tab of your project's Workflow Editor, all iOS and Android code signing fields are displayed in one page for you.

Let's see the process step by step!

### Sign your Android project

1. Select the `deploy` workflow at the `WORKFLOW` dropdown menu in the top left corner of your apps' Workflow Editor.
2. Go to the `Code Signing` tab.
3. Drag-and-drop your keystore file to the `ANDROID KEYSTORE FILE` field.
4. Fill out the `Keystore password`, `Keystore alias`, and `Private key password` fields and click `Save metadata`.

   You should have these already at hand as these are included in your keystore file which is generated in Android Studio prior to uploading your app to Bitrise. For more information on keystore file, click [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing). With this information added to your `Code Signing` tab, our `Sign APK step` (by default included in your Android deploy workflow) will take care of signing your APK so that it’s ready for distribution!

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="More information on Android code signing" content=" Head over to our [Android code signing guide](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/code-signing/android-code-signing/android-code-signing-procedures/) to learn more about your code signing options!"%}

![](/img/android-code-signing-react.png)

The Android chunk of code signing is done!

### Sign and export your iOS project for testing

Code signing your iOS project depends on what you wish to do with the exported .ipa file. In this section, we describe how to code sign your project if you wish to **install and test it on internal testers' registered devices**. You will need an .ipa file exported with the `development` export method to share your project with testers.

If you wish to upload your .ipa file to an app store, check out [this](/getting-started-with-reactnative-apps/#sign-and-export-your-ios-project-for-deployment) section!

{% include message_box.html type="note" title="Automatic provisioning" content=" The example procedure described here uses manual provisioning, with the `Certificate and profile installe` Step. However, Bitrise also supports [automatic provisioning](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/code-signing/ios-code-signing/ios-auto-provisioning/) but it is not in the scope of this guide. "%}

You will need:

* the automatically created `deploy` workflow
* an iOS **Development** certificate (a .p12 certificate file)
* a **Development** type Provisioning Profile

1. Set the code signing type of your project in Xcode to either manual or automatic (Xcode managed), and generate an .ipa file locally.
2. Collect and upload the code signing files with [the codesigndoc tool](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/code-signing/ios-code-signing/collecting-files-with-codesigndoc/).

   The tool can also upload your code signing files to Bitrise - we recommend doing so! Otherwise, upload them manually: enter the Workflow Editor and select the `Code signing` tab, then upload the files in their respective fields.
3. Go to your app’s Workflow Editor, and select the `deploy` workflow in the `WORKFLOW` dropdown menu in the top left corner.
4. Check that you have the `Certificate and profile installer` Step in your workflow. It must be before the `Xcode Archive & Export for iOS` Step (you can have other Steps between the two, like `Xcode Test for iOS`).
5. Check the `Select method for export` input of the `Xcode Archive & Export for iOS` Step. By default, it should be the `$BITRISE_EXPORT_METHOD` environment variable. This variable stores the export method you selected when creating the app. If you selected `development` back then, you don’t need to change the input. Otherwise, manually set it to `development`.

   ![Export method env var](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/img/export-method-envvar.png)
6. [Start a build](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/builds/starting-builds-manually/).

If you uploaded the correct code signing files, the `Certificate and profile installer` Step should install your code signing files and the `Xcode Archive & Export for iOS` Step should export an .ipa file with the **development export method**. If you have the `Deploy to Bitrise.io`Step in your workflow, you can find the .ipa file on the `APPS & ARTIFACTS` tab of the Build's page.

{% include message_box.html type="info" title="About iOS code signing" content=" iOS code signing is often not this simple - read more about how [iOS code signing works on Bitrise](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/code-signing/ios-code-signing/code-signing)!"%}

### Sign and export your iOS project for deployment

If you set up your code signing files and created an .ipa file for your internal testers, it is time to **involve external testers and then to publish your iOS app to the App Store**.

To deploy to Testflight and to the App Store, you will need more code signing files:

* an iOS **Distribution** Certificate
* an **App Store** type Provisioning Profile

1. On your local machine, set up App Store code signing for your project in Xcode, and export an App Store .ipa file. If this fails locally, it will definitely fail on Bitrise, too!
2. Collect and upload the code signing files with [the codesigndoc tool](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/code-signing/ios-code-signing/collecting-files-with-codesigndoc/).
3. Go to the app’s Workflow Editor and create a [new workflow](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/getting-started-workflows/): click the `+ Workflow` button, enter the name of your new workflow and in the **BASED ON** dropdown menu, select `deploy`. This way the new workflow will be a copy of the basic `deploy` workflow.
4. Set the `Select method for export` input of the `Xcode Archive & Export for iOS` Step to `app-store`.

   ![App store export](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/img/app-store-export.png)

   If you wish to distribute your app to external testers without uploading the app to Testflight, select `ad-hoc` method and make sure you have the `Deploy to Bitrise.io` step in your workflow.

## Test your project

You can use React Native's built in testing method, called `jest`. Add another `Run nmp command` step to your workflow, and type `test` in the `npm command with arguments to run` input field.

![](/img/run-nmp-test.png)

## Deploy to Bitrise

The `Deploy to bitrise.io` step uploads all the artifacts related to your build into the[ APPS & ARTIFACTS ](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/builds/build-artifacts-online/)tab on your Build’s page.

You can share the generated APK/.ipa file with your team members using the build’s URL. You can also notify user groups or individual users that your APK/.ipa file has been built.

1. Go to the `Deploy to bitrise.io` step.
2. In the `Notify: User Roles`, add the role so that only those get notified who have been granted with this role. Or fill out the `Notify: Emails` field with email addresses of the users you want to notify. Make sure you set those email addresses as [secret env vars](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/builds/env-vars-secret-env-vars/)! These details can be also modified under `Notifications` if you click the `eye` icon next to your generated APK/.ipa file in the `APPS & ARTIFACTS` tab.

## Deploy to an app store

If you wish to deploy your iOS app, follow the steps in [Code sign your iOS project for deployment](/getting-started/getting-started-with-react-native-apps/#sign-and-export-your-ios-project-for-deployment).

### Deploy your iOS app to Testflight and iTunes Connect

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Have you exported an `app-store` .ipa file yet" content=" Make sure that you have exported an `app-store` .ipa file before starting the deployment procedure to a native marketplace!"%}

1. Add the `Deploy to iTunes Connect - Application Loader` Step to your workflow, after the `Xcode Archive & Export for iOS` Step but preferably before the `Deploy to Bitrise.io` Step.
2. Provide your Apple credentials in the `Deploy to iTunes Connect - Application Loader` Step.

   The Step will need your:
   * Apple ID
   * password or, if you use two-factor authentication on iTunes Connect, your application password.

   Don’t worry, the password will not be visible in the logs or exposed - [that’s why it is marked SENSITIVE](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/builds/env-vars-secret-env-vars#about-secrets).
3. [Start a build](/builds/Starting-builds-manually/).

   If everything went well, you should see your app on Testflight. From there, you can distribute it to external testers or release it to the App Store.

### Deploy your Android app to Google Play Store

{% include message_box.html type="important" title="Android code signing" content=" Make sure that you have uploaded the keystore file to the `ANDROID KEYSTORE FILE` field!"%}

1. Make sure you are in sync with Google Play Store! Learn how to
   * [register to Google Play Store and set up your project](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/tutorials/deploy/android-deployment/#register-to-google-play-store-and-set-up-your-first-project)
   * set up [Google Play API access](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/tutorials/deploy/android-deployment/#set-up-google-play-api-access)
2. In your Bitrise `Dashboard`, go to `Code Signing` tab and upload the service account JSON key into the `GENERIC FILE STORAGE.`
3. Copy the env key which stores your uploaded file’s url.

   For example: `BITRISEIO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY_URL`
4. Add the `Google Play Deploy` step after the `Sign APK` step in your deploy workflow.
5. Fill out the required input fields as follows:
   * `Service Account JSON key file path`: This field can accept a remote URL so you have to provide the environment variable which contains your uploaded service account JSON key. For example: `$BITRISEIO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY_URL`
   * `Package name`: the package name of your Android app
   * `Track`: the track where you want to deploy your APK (alpha/beta/rollout/production)

And that’s it! Start a build and release your Android app to the app store of your choice.
