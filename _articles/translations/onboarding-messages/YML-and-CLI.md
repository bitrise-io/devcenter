This is the third onboarding email we send out for new developers.
With your help, we could send Japanese messages to our new Japanese users. :)

Now that you know how to setup your workflows, it's the right time to take your CI skills to the next level. üëç

When you were updating your workflow you were updating your app's bitrise.yml file. It can be found in your app's workflow editor under the bitrise.yml tab.

If you would like to, you can modify this yaml file or even download it to your local machine and place it in your git repository. Even better, you can download our [Bitrise CLI](https://app.bitrise.io/cli) and run the same workflow we're running on Bitrise, locally.

The CLI is open source and you can use it to easily develop integrations for Bitrise. If you want to share it with the community simply add it back to the [Bitrise Step Library](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib) with a Pull Request and reach out to us to get a $25/mo discount,because you are awesome! üëæ

Feel free to contact me here or through the on-site chat at any time if you have any questions!
