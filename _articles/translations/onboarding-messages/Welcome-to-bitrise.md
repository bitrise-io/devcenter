welcome to Bitrise!

It's great to have you on board. We put together some information to get you started with Bitrise. üöÄ

If you haven't done so yet, you'll need to add your app. Once that's done, check out the guide below! 

Add your first app!

We will help you through this process with our wizard.

Once your app is added you're good to go with the default workflow, but the real fun begins when you start customising it to fit your development process. Tomorrow, we'll follow up with some additional information to help you do just that üòâ
