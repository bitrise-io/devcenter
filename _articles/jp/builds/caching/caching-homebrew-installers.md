The **Brew install** Step supports caching: if the option is enabled, any downloaded brew installers will be cached from the location of `brew --cache`. The cache path is `~/Library/Caches/Homebrew/`.

## Enabling caching

To enable caching of brew installers:

1. Go to the Workflow in which you want to cache brew installs and select the **Brew install** Step.
2. Set the **Cache** option to `yes`.
3. As always, click **Save**.
