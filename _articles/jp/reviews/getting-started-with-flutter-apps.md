Flutter is a mobile app SDK that allows developers to create native apps for both iOS and Android. Bitrise supports Flutter apps: we have dedicated Steps to help you with all your Flutter needs. This guide walks you through setting up, testing, building and deploying a simple Flutter app on Bitrise.

## Adding a Flutter app

{% include message_box.html type="note" title="Do you have a Bitrise account?" content=" Make sure you have signed up to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io) and can access your Bitrise account. Here are [4 ways](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/getting-started/index#signing-up-to-bitrise) on how to connect your Bitrise account to your account found on a Git service provider. "%}

 1. Click the `+` sign on the top menu bar and select `Add app`.
 2. On the `Create New App` page, choose the account you wish to add the app to.
 3. Set the privacy of the app to either Private or [Public](/getting-started/adding-a-new-app/public-apps) and click `Next`.
 4. Select the Git hosting service that hosts your repository, then find and select your repository that hosts the project. Read more about [connecting your repository](/getting-started/adding-a-new-app/connecting-your-repository).
 5. When prompted to set up repository access, click `No, auto-add SSH key`. Read more about [SSH keys](/getting-started/adding-a-new-app/setting-up-ssh-keys/).
 6. Type the name of the branch that includes your project's configuration - master, for example - then click `Next`.
 7. Wait while Bitrise is validating your project.

    We look for your configuration files and set up your app based on them. In the case of Flutter apps, you definitely need a `pubspec.yaml` file in your project.
 8. Choose a stack.

    If you are not sure [which one of our stacks](/infrastructure/available-stacks/) you wish to use, just leave it on the default value!
 9. If you have both an iOS and an Android project in your Flutter repo, you will be prompted to select:
    * an export method for the iOS project
    * the variant you want to use for the Android project
10. Register a webhook when prompted.

    With a webhook, Bitrise can start a build automatically when code is pushed to your repository, or a pull request is created. This also kicks off your first build - click the message and it will take you to the build page.

## Testing a Flutter app

You can write and run **unit-**, **widget-,** and **integration** tests with Flutter. For more information, check out [Flutter's official documentation](https://flutter.io/docs/testing).

You can use our automatically generated `primary` workflow to test your Flutter app. This contains the necessary Steps to install the Flutter SDK and to test your Flutter app on Bitrise.

1. Open your app's Workflow Editor and open the `primary` workflow.
2. In the `Flutter Install` Step, fill in the `Flutter SDK Version` input.

   You can specify either tags or branches of the Flutter SDK's git repository. The default value is `stable`. This will use the latest stable branch of Flutter.
   * To find the available version tags, check: [https://github.com/flutter/flutter/releases](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/releases "https://github.com/flutter/flutter/releases")
   * To see the the available branches, check: [https://github.com/flutter/flutter/branches](https://github.com/flutter/flutter/branches "https://github.com/flutter/flutter/branches")
3. To the `Flutter Test` Step, add any flags you wish to use to the `Additional parameters` input.

   The Step runs the `flutter test` command with these flags. To check the available flags, open a command line interface on your own machine and run `flutter test --help`.
4. Make sure the `Project Location` input of the `Flutter Test` Step is correct.

   The default value is the the environment variable created for your Flutter project's location.

Run a build! Once it's done, you can find your test results on the `Apps and Artifacts` tab of the **Build** page of the app.

## Deploying a Flutter app

To build and deploy a Flutter app, we recommend creating a new workflow based on the automatically created `deploy` workflow. As a minimum, the workflow must contain these Flutter Steps:

* `Flutter Install`
* `Flutter Build`

You can build both iOS and Android projects at the same time or you can build them separately, each using their own workflow. You can set this in the `Platform` input of the `Flutter Build` Step.

Here's an example workflow we'll use in this configuration, with all the necessary Steps:

![{{ page.title }}](/img/flutter-workflow.png)We'll discuss the Steps specific to iOS and Android deployment in their respective sections!

### Deploying to Bitrise

The `Deploy to bitrise.io` step uploads all the artifacts related to your build into the[ APPS & ARTIFACTS ](/builds/build-artifacts-online/)tab on your Build’s page.

You can share the generated APK/.ipa file with your team members using the build’s URL. You can also notify user groups or individual users that your APK/.ipa file has been built.

1. Go to the `Deploy to bitrise.io` step.
2. In the `Notify: User Roles`, add the role so that only those get notified who have been granted with this role. Or fill out the `Notify: Emails` field with email addresses of the users you want to notify. Make sure you set those email addresses as [secret env vars](/builds/env-vars-secret-env-vars/)! These details can be also modified under `Notifications` if you click the `eye` icon next to your generated APK/.ipa file in the `APPS & ARTIFACTS` tab.

### Deploying a Flutter app to App Store Connect

To deploy your iOS Flutter project to the App Store, you'll need to build the app, export an .ipa file and submit it to the App Store.

Unlike testing, this requires code signing files:

* an iOS Distribution Certificate (a .p12 file)
* an App Store Provisioning Profile

Read more about iOS code signing on Bitrise in [our detailed guides](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/code-signing/ios-code-signing/code-signing/)!

1. Make sure you have the `Certificate and profile installer` Step in your workflow.
2. [Upload the required code signing files](/code-signing/ios-code-signing/ios-manual-provisioning/) to Bitrise.
3. Open the `Flutter Build` Step and find the `iOS Platform Configs` input group.
4. Make sure the `Additional parameters` input has the value `--release`.
5. Add the `Xcode Archive & Export for iOS` Step to the workflow.

   It should be after the `Flutter Build` Step.
6. Set the `Select method for export` input of the Step to `app-store`.
7. Add the `Deploy to iTunes Connect` Step to the end of the workflow.
8. Provide your Apple credentials in the respective input fields.
   * Apple ID
   * password or, if you use two-factor authentication on iTunes Connect, your application password.

   Don’t worry, the password will not be visible in the logs or exposed - [that’s why it is marked SENSITIVE](/builds/env-vars-secret-env-vars#about-secrets).
9. [Start a build]()!

If all goes well, the Step will submit the app to App Store Connect. You can, from the App Store Connect page, distribute the app to external testers via Testflight, or release it to the App Store itself.

### Deploying a Flutter app to Google Play

To deploy your app to Google Play, you need to export an APK file and sign it.

You can [configure the signing](https://flutter.io/docs/deployment/android#configure-signing-in-gradle) in the app's `build.gradle` file and then Flutter will sign your app during the build phase.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the other option: how to sign your APK file on Bitrise and then deploy the app to Google Play. First, you will need to [create a keystore file](https://flutter.io/docs/deployment/android#create-a-keystore) and then upload it to Bitrise.

1. Open your app's Workflow Editor.
2. Go to the `Code Signing` tab.
3. Drag-and-drop your keystore file to the `ANDROID KEYSTORE FILE` field.
4. Fill out the `Keystore password`, `Keystore alias`, and `Private key password` fields and click `Save metadata`.

Once that is done, you are ready to configure a workflow to deploy the app.

1. Make sure you are in sync with Google Play Store!

   Learn how to:
   * [register to Google Play Store and set up your project](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/tutorials/deploy/android-deployment/#register-to-google-play-store-and-set-up-your-first-project)
   * set up [Google Play API access](https://devcenter.bitrise.io/deploy/android-deploy/deploying-android-apps/#setting-up-google-play-api-access)
2. In your Bitrise `Dashboard`, go to `Code Signing` tab and upload the service account JSON key into the `GENERIC FILE STORAGE.`
3. Copy the env key which stores your uploaded file’s url.

   For example: `BITRISEIO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY_URL`
4. Add the `Sign APK` Step to your workflow.

   It should be after the `Flutter Build` Step.
5. Open the `Flutter Build` Step and find the `Android Platform Configs` input group.
6. Make sure the `Additional parameters` input has the value `--release`.
7. Add the `Google Play Deploy` Step after the `Sign APK` Step to your workflow.
8. Fill out the required input fields as follows:
   * `Service Account JSON key file path`: This field can accept a remote URL so you have to provide the environment variable which contains your uploaded service account JSON key. For example: `$BITRISEIO_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON_KEY_URL`
   * `Package name`: the package name of your Android app
   * `Track`: the track where you want to deploy your APK (alpha/beta/rollout/production)

And that’s it! Start a build and release your Android app to the app store of your choice.
