You can deploy multiple flavor APKs in one workflow using our `Gradle Runner` step. You will need to do some settings to `Sign APK` and `Google Play Deploy` steps - so keep you eyes peeled! But first a little recap on the most important terms we will use in this guide.

## About build types, flavors and build variants

Build types mean the way your build is packaged, for example, compiled as `debug` or `release`. 

Flavor means when an app's core code is enhanced with features resulting in different versions of the same app (just to mention the most common examples: free/paid, demo/full). 

Finally, where all of the above blends together is build variant, which we will mention in this guide a lot. Build variant means the combination of flavors and build types, for example: 

* freeDebug 
* freeRelease 
* paidDebug 
* paidRelease

## Generate APKs

Once you have a deploy workflow (as an example find the screenshot below) do the following:

1. Insert `Gradle Runner` step after testing steps to your deploy workflow. `Android Build` step can only build one variant so if this step is part of your workflow, then we advise you to replace it with `Gradle Runner` step.
2. Click the `Config` section.
3. Specify the `assemble` [Gradle task](/tips-and-tricks/android-tips-and-tricks/#what-are-gradle-tasks-and-how-can-i-get-the-list-of-available-tasks-in-my-project/) by adding your build variants' task names in the `Gradle task to run` step input field - as many tasks names as many build variants you want to build in one workflow. Each task name must be **exactly the same build variant name** what you have in listed in `Build Variant` window of Android Studio! Make sure you separate them only with a space, no need for `,`! In the below image, you can see the order of the steps for the deploy workflow and the `Gradle Task to run` step input with two build variants we're building:

   `assembleMyflavorDebug` and `assembleMyflavorDebugAndroidTest`

   Gradle Runner generates a `$BITRISE_APK_PATH_LIST` env var output that contains ALL the build variants you have set in the step above. We will need this output later - keep it handy!

## Signing and deploying

To code sign and deploy your multiple flavor APKs, follow the steps:

1. Add the `Sign APK` step AFTER the `Gradle Runner` step if it's missing from your workflow.
2. Set the `$BITRISE_APK_PATH_LIST` in the `apk path` input field. This will make sure all the required APKs will get code signed with the keystore file you uploaded to the `Code Signing` tab. Check out [how you can upload your keystore file to bitrise.io](/code-signing/android-code-signing/android-code-signing-using-bitrise-sign-apk-step/#create-a-signed-apk-with-the-sign-apk-step/). The step will export a `$BITRISE_SIGNED_APK_PATH` env var output.
3. Add the `Google Play Deploy` step AFTER the `Sign APK` step.
4. Set the `$BITRISE_SIGNED_APK_PATH` env var in the `APK or App Bundle file path` step input field so that Google Play Deploy can release all your build variants set in this env var.

### Signing and deploying a white label app

If you have a white label app and you want to distribute it with different features (for example, color or logo) to resellers you need to use different keystore files. If you want to build multiple flavors in a single workflow for different resellers, you need to use different keystore files. We advise you to code sign your project as described in [Sign your app for release](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing)  [https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants](https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants "https://developer.android.com/studio/build/build-variants") section of the Android Studio Guide. Make sure you store the keystore file in the same folder where you had it during the code signing and
